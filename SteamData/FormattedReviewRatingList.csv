love it,1
dawn  war   is such  great game in terms  graphic  sound  animation    unfortunately  it lacks good game design  gameplay mechanics that could be fixed   i still hope   somehow could be    do not u get it dev  we want soulstorm in dow   graphics ,1
   e n d  e s s  t   s ,0
if i wanted  play starcraft  i would play starcraft  not  shitty version  it that totally breaks what dow      were  it helps  little now though that i have learned there is  pause button in singleplayer where you can queue commands right about when i am mostly through with  campaign   makes no sense that they increase micro management     quicker   while at  same time increase  scale  fights  combat  unit pop   only thing i can guess what relic was thinking was that they tried too hard  make it like other games  they should have learned by   that dow needs its own formula ,0
i am not one  be negative about games  but this is not worth  buy at all  this game could have been great  relic really let me down on this one  if you are on   about buying it  just pass on it  there are other warhammer titles ,0
very fun game   recommend  game ,1
thanks for   great franchise   despite some nice game design features  this game is an insult  every previous dawn  war instalment  all they had  do was improve on dawn  war ii  they would have ended up with  great game  by every gamer    instead  that they decided   develop  release  garbage game ,0
i started this franchise with dawn  war   i personally like  hero elite form  rts rather than  base building  massive army battles  i have seen many say that dow   is  mixture        that it is not very good  i would   only on  premise that i did not play  original   i think  campaign is very good  even if i do  with it at times  looking at you campaign mission     i have only played  multiplayer with ai     while i do understand  moba feel  i have  say  i kind  enjoy it  i recently also tried  annihilation mode as well  had  fun time with it    i can see where  loyal fans  dawn  war were let down with   but i still feel that it is  great game with  good campaign  pretty decent multiplayer  it is sad that development stopped on dow   but hopefully   will be  game that  loyal fans wanted  i will still be enjoying       eventually will  into  original    ,1
sad  see what was previously an excellent rts series turn down    an moba cash grab  if you like bland   gameplay  look no further ,0
this is  first time i have not completed  games campaign   game was   boring   total waste  money  i was  fan  both dawn  war    could appreciate  different  for each game  however  this game can not  on what it is trying  be      very disappointing    ,0
i will upvote anything with  warhammer  in  name  even if it is    not fantasy    but damn this micromanagement hell is annoying  i do not have enough add  keep track  everything  this game would be  lot more fun if there were not so many  things  micromanage  this is exactly why dow   is failing compared    what were they thinking ,1
been   emperor since  early   is  game is still awesome  although i wish that  chaotic  was  same as back then ,1
this sad blend  rts  moba missed   by sooo much  all they had  do was make new textures  models for dawn  war    one   most fun rts ever   even dawn  war   was better than this  despite all  rts elements they removed   singleplayer was less fun than playing   or   because  gameplay formula is dull  multiplayer was dead on arrival  steam     says  player population    per day currently  it was  moba with extra steps ,0
i feel sorry for  obviously talented sound  graphic designers who worked hard on making this game look  sound  mostly  great    game itself is dull  monotonous  uninspired  just outright boring   same environments   same terrain meant  same tactics    plot was not too bad  until towards  end     into  planet  really    using    orks usually  down    lots  things     which was fine  but  eldar were just fucking terrible which made even  simplest mission frustrating  throw in  regular crashes  oh boy did i save  lot   at times i got so pissed off i had  close steam  do something else    sad disappointment   game which had so much  ,0
fun story  distinct races   gameplay that  up years later  recommended  anyone who loves  good rts ,1
if they would like  make next dawn  war they should abandon almost every idea from this part  due     rts  hard grind present in dow iii is very   deal with  you need  grind level for elites  it is   level  not in match hero level like it was in warcraft   for example   higher  level   more tactics you can pick for your army  hero power stays      same  there is option  disable elites tactics  in match  after which you will get multiplayer experience very close  what was in dow   not terrible but could be better  like in soulstorm for example   elites had  bit wrong   but overall heroes are very  idea in my opinion   it reminds me  warcraft   they give some   old concept  online rts  but they are    especially in  hands  good players   i really do not get  idea  devs for dow overall   they are  it from its unique gameplay  make it more like  company  heroes  i can not say company  heroes is  bad game  but we do not want  see dawn  war as  company  heroes clone but in   universe  let us stay with players most favorite experience from dow i  if you want  make coh clone in   universe  make it as separate game   do not mix them together  it is not working  players do not want  play it  not because it is bad  but because it is not  good   warhammer   i believe this is why call   or  for example is selling so good  because it is stays  same    dow in my personal opinion would be campaign as  result  mixing dark crusade soulstorm dow    with long   bit  story  multiplayer from any dow i expansion  additional   players  co op from dow   that could be playable with bots  i mean it was cool with players  but dow   never had  big   later on  it was impossible  find game    achievements without xp mods from steam workshop will take   pointless grind  get them  game could have  bit better   but there is no point in making it happen in this part   it is      oh    big minus for  lack  playable chaos in this part   this does not really count for my   but i would like  see them       it has   worst single player campaign in  whole series that feels like skirmish with additional character lines  some objectives   do not buy it   wait for next part that will hopefully be better ,0
awesome  d for  empire ,1
it is fun  it is good  so everyone should get it ,1
yes,1
even better than    i loved    that game for  long time  very     highly recommend this for fans     universe  anyone that   well made  rewarding in depth rts   they removed  skulls thing so u have access   majority  doctrines from level    all   elites   campaign has taken  different approach  previous campaigns with great story line   awesome cinematics ,1
thats an  with high quality graphics nice story  active  thats an really good game,1
 doesnt even do my    where is  grimdark  where is  base building  where is everything that made dark crusade great  where is an    story   i get more entertainment from   than this garbage ,0
 disgrace  warhammer   franchise  they took everything that makes   good   they removed them like  joke damn shame  call this shallow garbage  ,0
better than launch,1
wtf is wrong with you guys  this is one   best rts game since   also one   best looking ones  overall  for me   best looking game in  warhammer universe  i can not believe it  such  piece  art is not  well   community  relic  you made such  great game   so sad that we will not see some more updates or dlcs   ,1
good,0
felt like  dawn  war game but with enough spice  make it different ,1
crap,0
absolutely disgusting  stupid gameplay  story line  space  attack again  humans look like dumb  again fighting against  eldar who are trying  save  freaking universe  game plays as  moba  sorts even with all  changes   levels are small  look like   upgrades take forever  gameplay is  around using heroes since everything else takes forever  build because even with maxed resource points they simply generate too little  both   graphics are quite decent  instead  making this crap  they should simply remade dow soulstorm or   retribution with  graphics  better soundtrack  it is like they are trying hard  make  low quality game that   lot  instead  making  fun game that everyone would enjoy,0
more content would be nice,1
what  disappointment   just how  up  moba multiplayer part   game is  which many other people have already  on    single player is just poor  with no difficulty  or  challenge    final mission  what an   game design   spirit  dow   let us take away all your base building   your armies  just give you   elite units for  whole mission  which ends in   boss battle  which you have  micro manage  win  it is    what made dawn  war  good rts  i got this in  humble bundle  glad i basically did not spend any money on it  spend your time  hard earn cash on something else  i feel so sorry for    sound   developers etc etc that worked on this  they were lead down  wrong  by designers  marketing wanting  get onto  moba bandwagon ,0
such  shame this game tried  be something it should never have been  it failed  for that we may never see another dawn  war game again    i loved this franchise  i guess it is back  soulstorm apocalypse mod then  ,0
just played through all  dow games up  this one   i only played it  bit  but did not like what i played  judging from all  other reviews it does not get better  they did not try  fix it  seems they should give  dow series    make  tw with when they finish warhammer fantasy ,0
classic,1
an insult  dawn  war  wtf happened ,0
amazing game,1
this game  down    setting   characters are awesome  but  game itself is pretty shallow with non existing tactical depth  also   three races have  exactly same play style  build  bigger army    enemy  very disappointing considering how different    orks are supposed  be  also   cover system    my   what were they thinking  only recommended for  fans   dark  ,0
dawn  war more like fun game ,1
loved  first dawn  war  all  expansions  less  on dawn  war   but still enjoyed it overall  i have no idea what  developers were thinking when they made this  it seems  have dropped everything i enjoyed about  last   games   scale      cover mechanics tactical gameplay    it is  matter  personal taste really but i also really dislike  cartoony look they went for  graphics  i played   for over   but could not make it past mission   or     campaign in this  after  few multiplayer matches  i hated it  uninstalled ,0
just beat  campaign  i see why so many people were upset by this game  wait for it  go on   sale     lack  missions  last mission is  chore  i did not have fun  was ready for it  be over    feel cheated out  cinematics  replaced with  still    story was okayish    least i got my  ,0
i have never played this game  please disregard this review,1
it is just  bit meh  i never even managed  finish  campaign first time through   it  it is just no fun which is  real shame as i was  big fan  dow,0
this is  solid experience  well worth  price   for  general   fan   care is taken with  lore  characters  over   but  be fair   this game  with  formula   previous dawn  war titles   it with  far more linear experience   i would be   call it   down  rts as  simplified  faster rts  experience because there is no failure here on  part   developers   it is   choice than many franchises might adopt  but there is plenty here for      series   newer gamer   at   cut  you simply spam  units needed for   at hand  but there is   reward for     by  campaign  multiplayer options   very   extremely loyal     universe  solid overall ,1
blood for  blood god,1
 great game  left   by       mod community have come      make this game still worth    worth  effort   ,1
i do not know what  game was like on release  but  game is absolutely  i enjoyed every moment  it  love  play it with friends   only problem is  online player base  its not very active   devs should make  free version where you can only play as  empire  man with   limited elites so  game gets  casual player base  also making dlc factions for     piece like  tau  chaos  dark eldar  necrons would be  super nice addition   my advice though is  turn off elites  doctrines on your first matches  as  elites are super micro manage heavy  need  get used too   its likely true however that it  way too much from starcraft  i would also highly advice  only buy this game during  high sale ,1
there are few examples in video games   potential worse than dawn  war iii ,0
 intro cinematic is    campaign is fairly good  but this game has sadly been  at   board  too much complexity for  sake  complexity  off putting models  cartoony animations  very few races  choose from  too much trying  be  moba  as somebody with   hours in      it  me  say it  but this is  huge  ,0
bland  too few factions  too little story  compared with dow  dowii  massive   maybe i will give it another try in  future    but i doubt it ,0
i played tons  dawn  war   i would still come back  it over this time  again   main reason many   fans  about dow was for  story  campaigns  which this game basically  into   i received this game for free via  press account  still  it because i knew i would never play it again ,0
 storyline is lacking   gameplay is monotonous   controls are also  ,0
mid,0
several bugs in  menu  in game  story is weak  seems like they  this after starcraft versus trying  do something unique for gameplay ,0
very good,1
meh,0
do not bother with this  not worth it even on sale or humble  combat does not feel   controlling units  their  is clunky  you can more or less just attack move everything  focus on managing just your elites   multiplayer mode has some fucked up moba  in place for no real reason   sp campaign forces you  play all   races  changing   next race every mission  so if you do not like one or two  them  you are gonna hate it  probably drop it rather than put yourself through that  only care about space marine  or eldar  or orks  tough luck   only   out    missions is gonna be   you then it is back  another two you do not give  shit about  no thanks  dow     master race dow     ok  but overall worse sequel  except for maybe rpg sp elements dow      ,0
while  great idea in concept   plan     basic units created through base building has  in  game that is either  dull   or  generic hero   i assume  developers thought this would be an easy cash  as   fans love their hero units   with  minimal number  special units   army  system   only   races there was  obvious structure  for    style  system  as there is no longer any support   game is   die  hopefully  devs clean   come back with  dow game that is worthy   previous titles ,0
completely different   amazing dow   devs took nothing great from their previous games  when everyone hated it they abandoned  game  do not bother ,0
someone obviously put  lot  love into  animations    lot  thought into     sound design is  as well  those   are  joy  listen too   this game is perhaps  most gorgeous rts i have ever played  some   game play elements are  such as  hero units  i like them because they add     game styles you can play  but they also further limit your unit selection in an already   game  over all though  matches are fun  fast paced   atmosphere    music   combination  is also incredible  if you like warhammer   or rts games you will have fun with this one  some   units do not behave like they should  but there is no better way  experience  grimdark world   ,1
i am not too bothered about  multiplayer aspect  so far i very much enjoy  game   campaign is fun  i enjoy   solo skirmishes against ai  while i miss some minor things found in   previous   like  recall retreat button   game keeps me engaged  i keep coming back for more ,1
great game have played both previous dawn  wars  love  warhammer   games,1
meh not bad,1
buy this game,1
game breaking can not continue bug on mission  ,0
well  this game sucks  i liked  first one  loved  second one  though i did miss  base building aspect  this one is just    not good   gameplay is  mess  often i would try  select multiple units  for some reason my  would just   some far off corner on  map  it feels slow    commands  there is too much focus on your elites while your actual army feels like cannon fodder  while at  same time bringing  much focus  your freaking unit abilities    it is just  mess   but  worst part though  while this may be very much   which one  you  designed this campaign  let me play my marines in   i do not want  jump from marines   orks   eldar   whatever comes next because i could not care  push through  ugh ,0
yes ,1
this may in  be  least   dawn  war games  but it is  in fact  still  good game    gonna hate  but    does not deserve   it is gotten   it is  decent rts that gets everything  right  but   single player campaign does make it hard  love  you are forced  skip from race  race with every mission  that makes it hard  develop any true  for any  them even by  end   game   another  let down is  lack   last stand mode  which by itself probably would have made        aside from that though  there is still fun  be had here in skirmish  multiplayer   it all looks great  too ,1
do i   game yes  do i recommend  developer publisher hell no      you  dawn  war franchise ,1
you like warhammer   play  game ,1
this is almost    game  you can play around with  single player but it is  multiplayer you are after  it is  most fun i have had in  competitive rts    joy  beating other players is really rewarding in this game  each battle feels intense  bad ass     dark atmosphere coupled with  visuals   futuristic war sounds makes this one   most unique experiences you will ever have on  pc   join our little community  see if you have what it takes  beat me ,1
great,1
i have only played  single player campaign   missions so far    it is good  not great  looks gorgeous  no bugs  but  start   campaign is confusing  playing all three factions   meaning you do not have time  get used  any  them  but half way through  missions improve massively  my biggest  with  gameplay is that most missions  long   time where you just wait  gain resources in order  create  upgrade units  otherwise  it is  more than  decent rts game   quite frankly i had  lot  fun with it ,1
visually this game is nice   it has interesting story for  blood ravens    characters  however   gameplay is terrible  controls   commands seem slow       un   this simplest things  such as  attack move command  seem difficult  give   track  this poor gameplay has sucked all enjoyment out  this game ,0
kinda  ,1
not worth  money or   space   ,0
its less   strategy game  more    story that i do not care  hear   cinematics make you think your going  have these huge wars like total war  warhammer  no  its  opposite ,0
how can you fuck up so hard   thats  only question i have for relic ,0
they took  good rts  turned it into  lane    it looks like they  out  money  gave up on   single player experience,0
such  letdown   game has  ton  issues  bugs   main campaign   progress  my elites several times  putting them back at     ai is   after  completing  mission it will sometimes show an empty pop up   your option is    restart  game  every time upon launching  game it  my   on windows  i either have  log out  my windows account  log back in or restart so it goes back  normal   stuff aside   story is boring  at least it is not  level  dow retribution  where you have  replay   same stuff but with  different races ,0
its not as bad as people say  im having alot  fun with it   fights feel   look cool ,1
barely  just barely worth it if you played  other dawn  war games  can get it cheap   they somehow managed  combine  worst parts from dawn  war    retribution   out any base building fun from dawn  war    it is utterly    there are fewer resource points so they basically do whatever  game feels like at  time   sometimes you can get power  sometimes resources  sometimes you can upgrade it  sometimes not  it is frustrating  annoying   actual game play is   but things like   do not have any  any more   still  for one play through i guess it was ok ,1
if you like  dawn  war games you will love this one just get it,1
honestly  complete letdown for  series,0
did not feel  excitement   other games  did not feel anything  got bored  fast  sad i loved  other ones  i got  cards     ,0
great mission based single player   breaking multiplayer,1
no redeeming qualities   sad end   good franchise ,0
i would not recommend this for   dollars    do not get me wrong this one  true   warhammer formula but     game  breaks  flow  things  also  multiplayer has little players left  i have only encountered   players in  multiplayer with only   servers  this is  good game but could have been better  btw rts games do not hold up in today is standards  this generation would find them boring but as someone who was  in  early   i have played  lot  rts games so i am familiar with  formula  they could have made this into     loot  shoot then this game would have been   there really is no strategy  just click  watch enemies die but still you can use strategy but that will make  game longer  less fun  i can not recommend this   ,0
 on   franchise ,0
  is not it   ,1
 this is  waste  time     money    first  all   rts is long dead   i was hoping they will do some dow ii game with loot   rpg mechanics game  but this is crap   story is boring  last boss s unbalanced    do not buy this   let them understand that we need dow ii style games without this outdated base building  we do not want   bases  we want  ,0
 game that  its franchise by losing its vision  identity  believing it can attract both rts  moba fans while lacking on either front   warhammer game with starcraft ii is vision but so inferior  it is enough reason for you  just continue playing starcraft ii ,0
 only game i was   refund because i waited   hours  get  match  did not get  match  did not get  money  did not finish my  either  my  abandoned me   ,0
if you like company  heroes series  total war series     you will love this game ,1
am  fan  space marines so i like all that universe  for fans great for others recomend,1
this game is very ehh    i have not played it that long  i am already seeing flaws   factions seem very similar when in dawn  war      they were very diverse  for    you could get  other dawn  wars  that is  much better deal  it is not  bad game just very mediocre  you could get some good fun out  it  but for being  dawn  war game it is disappointing ,0
dow       are much better games   interface on this   is far too    graphics look like  mix between       it feels like  mobile game     do not bother ,0
this game is terrible even with mods ,0
not recommended  game abandoned by devs  no  why  would take an entire rebuild  make it good    bad enemy unit ai  no need for strategy or tactics   terrible unit   some units   map  are   even with  is  stop command    ranged units can    out when engaged in  only  stand there  die   negative resource army upkeep is never      units out      late game   units   you can attack behind cover walls if you have  making it one big open map   melee units can attack   units on top     makes for some dumb animations   doctrines exist but  selectable for  lot  missions  they include things like   while moving   other basic things you would expect from  start   mp is dead   simple things like  are locked down unless you grind elite units   unit  does not matter if you     game will  your entire army    stupid story bad  voice acting    let us wipe this ork from  board    not even grimdark  game throws you all over  place with sp mission structure  feels like they wanted  make an rpg rts moba  failed  ,0
 here is with   campaign mode   where dawn  war      were unique  fun in their own right    really let us  collection down  as  player  you are stuck playing  you would possibly never usually play  so your   in  story  campaign is minimal   campaign tries  tell   story   but does not  you  make  connection with     so  i  at least found myself not really caring    i also was not big on  mechanics  there are too many individual unit mechanics  jumping around  make this easy  get into  there are probably some fast  starcraft   guys that love this sort  thing  that said  i just could not get into it    it is flashy    at  same time   me it seemed there was not much substance    where  rest   series is    for me ,0
it was  fun game  i enjoyed it  i would recommend on sale,1
hot garbage  does not even hold    dow i  ii,0
i got this game in  humble bundle which means i payed maybe two dollars for it  i regret that purchase  this game is  far cry from  first two in  series    my reasoning  this game plays itself  all i have  do  beat  mission is  troops  any troops   mass them into  big   people  throw them at  enemy  in  first  second game there was much more strategy involved   stories that they told made me  in    each battle  i barely care about this game enough  give it this review   only reason you should buy this one is if you have  first two  want  complete your library  are okay with wasting money  do so ,0
great game,1
awkward  clunky   slow  try   original dawn  war instead  this is not  game you are looking for  unless you like crashes ,0
warhammer doing rts right for  past   years   if you are  fan  starcraft  rise  legends  warcraft iii then you will feel at home   plus  lore that  warhammer series  is      give dawn  war i  ii  if possible ,1
its actually   me how bad this game is  dawn  war   original  is was probably one   best rts games in  history    for dawn  war   is change  mechanics   different play style should have provided more than enough   learn their    instead  we  up with this   all that was necessary  get  solid    for effort was    original dow game play    in  little   rpg elements     progression from dark crusade   leveling from     campaign is short  uninspired   multiplayer was  designed as   get on  starcraft   bandwagon  attempt without  player base  support those     unit combat suffers from an    on use  abilities  it just is not fun   hard avoid  even at   ,0
overall still  great game ,1
i just got bored real fast with this game  if you ever played  original games you will have  much better time ,0
if you love warhammer  you will love it ,1
man  i only wish i did not suck at rts games  orks orks orks ,1
tldr  dawn  war   is  by  development is lack  focus   between  traditional strategy with  tactic strategy just can not mix well  nor is  grimdark future  well for  warhammer     terrible animations for space marines   warhammer   dawn  war     what  shame     seemed  get  back into     first dow with  twist by mixing it with  second dow    making some sort     game    what i mean by this  is because  campaign features about half   base building   first dow   more tactics  your  armies   in  because they feel like canon fodder   in addition  too much focus on elites  essentially making it feel like  moba but where you control  units  base building   this is not good   they could have saved it   less focus onto elites  fixing some  their rather    shitty  animations  see space marines   where orcs seem  be accurate  eldar more or less normal   space marines looking  bit like  with their one big  per shot from their heavy bolters   looking gabriel with his weird armor making him look like  space marine mixed with  terminator in addition  his    animations makes him look     just why     campaign features some challenges  which i have not finished because  game decided  crash   but also makes too much focus on unit abilities  which  frankly  does not mix well with traditional strategy games  it is quite clear they had  focus on being  game with high action per minute  apm  but with  resource management    good luck  really slow generation  resources    overall    relic went  easy way  quit trying  fix something  because graphically speaking  it is quite beautiful  cinematics  fantastic  game itself    does not   grimdark future where only war exist    if they focused it more as  traditional strategy  rather than  high apm esports game    they could have made  good  if not   great game ,0
actually pretty good game destroyed by   community ,1
its like they took its soul,0
buy   bit armies or dawn  war i instead,0
incompetent developers make for  chore instead   game  once again    is wasted on  that should   making  games on   just    entirely  relic account  form should tell you how little resources went into  game   complete mess where  e  field does not even accept an   character   devs are so  incompetent they actually managed  make   using    party service   that one up as well ,0
i liked  game  i can see why people think it is not  best   bunch  but in my opinion i think it has all  potential available  be  good game on its own  i just finished  campaign on   level  did  couple  hours in solo skirmish  guys     all you have  do is play multiplayer in  annihilation classic   disable any unit   plus   gui  map   left  commands   right   that is   experience    you will get   with epic battles with  battlefield full  units    space  everywhere   i will try  keep it short  here is what i liked    nobody seems  be talking about my points so take  read         major problem i had with  game is text  it is sooo   seriously wth  i simply can not read    i just ignore all  those  that  on screen     there is so much gui stuff on screen  click that you will get overwhelmed  this is in main   ingame  you will have  give it time  learn what each thing does  get used      too many   more  stage active abilities for units  in  heat  battle you do not have  time  wait for  next condition  occur  most   time  chance  complete    stage is never  or you have  cancel  ability  react  other quick   issue other commands     i really enjoyed  campaign   story is intriguing  although i would have never brought back any characters from past games  those characters  stories were  in   they are legends  it ended up being pretty interesting in  end but still  no go for me  also  wth with  last stage  what were  thinking      multiplayer  infantry units when  with other infantry units simply  into      you lose  squads within   seconds upon engaging in combat  i think they made it like this for  sake  realism  scale    titans can still be taken down by  bunch  infantry squads if  with heavy   that will at least give them  chance against powerful titans  mixed opinion  be honest     needs more multiplayer maps  army        i loved     changing cutscenes between   some call them lazy but i loved them  that one when macha  angelos  then she    webway gate  slowly sucked by it     that face    that      open    enemy   him  i am going  kill you later   you have  see it      developers  you with  system requirements  but  i have  pc from   with      core       graphics        i run  game maxed out in   resolution   though      i like  sense  scale  realism  that time when for  first time playing multiplayer you think you are god because you are  with  bunch  specialized squads plus some elite units  then you  face  face with  big ass titan that  more than half your screen    in real life  immediately fall back    be          campaign was fun  i would have made it longer though  skirmish multiplayer only fun when  annihilation classic  mode is played     ai in skirmish is tough   fun  at least i get my ass  most   time  i suck at  game i know it but i have fun trying  improve myself      game is fun  has mod support  even extend it  give it  chance  there is no other way  really experience it in full if you do not give your time  play it  i  you it was  same with   when released  do not be  cry baby  just remember  leave your politics out   game  enjoy  good things while you still can                                                                                        that was  fast track  my opinion based on   hours  experience with  game  i totally  your own opinion whatever it is  i left comments on  would like hear what you think about my points ,1
this is  game for people who are good at multi   i am not one  those people  there are  lot  things you have  manage compared  old rts games   bots are  overtuned  basically do everything at once  i am sure that if you are good at doing lots  things at once you will enjoy this as every battle keeps you very   there really is not any down time  if you are  down time then  are  enemy is about    bunch  your    only time i ever get  second  check how my resources are doing is when i can not   build something  every other second especially in  later game is spent spam building units  moving them around  try  keep them alive  i typically wait  play multi player until i master  matches  but maybe i will give multi player  chance  see how i  ,0
 game is all   no substance its tried  be  mixture  dawn  war    dawn  war   which is not  bad thing but  mechanics   game let it down  also for someone that likes  play against ai  lot before going online this is  poor ai  on casual difficulty  ai as your opponent  like  hard computer  your team  ai on casual  hard   stop  units  attacking mid game  overall  game lacks in  fun  ,0
please keep your politics out   warhammer universe,0
moba or rts not both it wants  be both but fails at both  also does not like running on my  for some reason,0
this is  joke it seems   horrible joke upon us    i am not sure how you  so much from dow ,0
honestly i  what  think  it but its  not  dawn  war    graphics are so  you like yeah this is going  be awesome  this looks beautiful then game starts  im like wtf is this   this looks old like worse than  first dawn  war games   but  game play feels like  first game but with  graphics   like wtf   i honestly do not know what  think  kinda  me  like why make  game then make  graphics worse than  first   series  was so hyped  now just gutted,0
it plays more like  moba than  warhammer game  but is not bad   lack  further support from  company  as well  apparently it did not sell well or something  i have had fun playing it though  but  be fair i got it out   massive bundle  only paid like  couple  for it ,1
not really worth  time,0
cool game lovely graphics,1
i find  community is very  on this game  i like playing  game  i prefer dow ii as  game modes are better  prefer  resource mechanics on  previous game too  but  game is still good  if you are buying this game though  please  around as i got it for   not    fact that  developer has killed it is player base instead   it was wrong though  i wish there were more armies  pick from    just is not enough ,1
its fun ,1
nope just nope worst installment in dow series,0
not knowing much about any   previous games  i just enjoy  space fantasy about it,1
another  great game in  truly awesome series     ,1
great game  need more modders  stop    get in  game ,1
this game is nothing like dow   or   its trying  be  moba or something  garbage ,0
despite all  bad press  i really enjoy  game   large scale fights can be epic  its challenging enough ,1
you can see that relic tried  do something new but that  direction  marketing   money hungry   wanted  take another direction     is  for identity   was  great base  game with good combat mechanics   was  great strategy game with deep combat mechanics      cover system    is trying  blend  bit  base building    bit  cover mechanics     i would not say it fails at both  there is some great stuff   elite is  good   that  but  they are so unbalanced that everything feels like fodder cannon in  end game   i am left with an overwhelming   knowing that   might have killed  dow franchise have such poor sales  reviews   do not get me wrong  i am sure that with some new races  re balanced mechanics    army   this could be  good game  but it will not if you wanna enjoy  bit  what   offers  wanna feel   buy  game for   no more ,0
at  point  this review i have   hours  playtime on it  right off i knew i  into another letdown with  sound effects  how does this keep happening   dawn  war series  from dow  dow ii  major letdown was  inferior sound effects   space marine   now this comes out  it feels like everything in  space marine  sounds pathetic   game play is   boring  especially with no obvious way  access  elite units  specifically  imperial knight   obviously i have not played enough   tutorials  i  through  first one as     previous two games bored       others were more   same  played against  ai too  orcs    that was pretty stupid  on casual   it takes forever  kill anything  you just slog through an     orcs even when controlling more than half  field   it is like they needed  make  space marines suck for some reason  i will try  game again after i cool down  but this is not what i expected with this level    fire  made this  have dow   done by people that actually give  damn about    universe please   if you bother at all   ,0
good game   campaign was  bit short for me  but i get that maybe  target was multiplayer gameplay   this game is far better than  first two for sure  anyone who says otherwise is   nostalgia   developers had good effort on this one  this game is quite old so i doubt it would get expansions anymore   but here is  hoping for  better sequel  one that  all  good parts  it is   possibly some   aspect  other warhammer games like   such   this game was  bit limited on content really  but it is  good game   would recommend for rts players ,1
i do recommend dawn  war iii   but i suggest  pick it up on sale  i had  negative  before playing because many people said  game was not good  but i wanted  give it  try given that i had enjoyed       all  their expansions   so i was  surprised with many positive aspects   action is good  animations are smooth   sounds  score all  together well  overall it is  good game  but my review only   single player  here are some  for      pause  game  give orders    this single feature made  game an absolute joy    queue up orders while  using  shift key    base building is here but not as in starcraft ii  you can not spam defensive structures     heroes  elites  are awesome    voice acted well  they feel      orks are funny    is well done     graphics are very nice    i got what i wanted out  this rts with space marines   eldars   orks   imperial titan units  terminator is assault ac   heavy bolters all sound as they should        universe is rich  an already  universe that i like   on  negative side     campaign felt too short    missions total   for each race     mixed race missions    you can no longer     for your squads as in      leveling up mechanic did not work during  campaign  this was an excellent part    but it is not present here    you can not   at all  your heroes during  campaign  i miss that from       were diverse but i would have liked  have more  vanilla  destroy  enemy    sometimes  missions feel too much  by story   gameplay suffers    but overall it was positive  i am super slow playing  campaign but that is all that i did   ,1
dow is  great series  it sucks there is not an easier way   or even save your troops  though    if you love   it is  must buy,1
shit game  there is only one   other than that  very boring campaign,0
this game is amazing idk why people dislike this game tbh,1
i think people are too hard on this game  this is not dow    many wish it were more like that  better  sure it is not perfect  but has some great things not in previous dow like  imperial knights etc  plus it is still  lot  fun  play  it could be  lot better  more like people want like dow   but this game is still fun  has so much potential  too bad it does not have more factions  troop types etc  but as i said it is still fun for me  there are also mods that are very easy  access that improve  game ,1
it is like dow ii  just not as good ,0
best franchise ever  love these games  every entry has amazing content,1
this game does not even let you customize your        glad i got it for two dollars ,0
this game got so much hate online i  it like    people said it was essentially  moba  that made me stay away from it  i finally  in  very   sale   it for   dollars  went in with zero expectations  quality  i am both pleasantly surprised  mildly upset that it is nothing like what i was told  pleasantly surprised at  game  upset at  people i     yes you have  destroy    then    then  core    win  you have   elite units that are somewhat hero like  but do not level up  then you have your base  there is base building   you have   units   upgrades  you know    sort  like an rts  there is no auto spawning minions going down  middle that provide exp  gold    i had just come off   dawn  war   campaign  dawn  war   is  game where you have limited squads that level up  get loot  yet somehow that got  pass  though yes i know there was some upset over it not being like   where   which is much much much closer    did not  i do not understand  apparently   did so poorly relic abandoned it   all plans for necrons   i am  future dlc   so that is  bit     this review has not been much   review though   voice lines can be  bit poor in some     animations can be  little   but it is  great game  definitely worth  purchase  especially if it is on sale but i would say even at full price  it is  more faithful sequel    than    it deserves  be fairly  ,1
i first thought  game  was  by former dawn  war  dawn  war ii fans but honestly  no its not   game itself in its current state feels boring   elites kinda lackluster  empty  like  hollow shell   game  it just  fun  go get dawn  war   instead  while  graphics might be old  well  its at least   years old  its much more fun than this game  maybe  game will not be empty  boring in  future but im not quite sure  it ,0
fun experience through  campaign  does not feel repetitive   keeps you engaged  ,1
this game does not even deserve   review  not because it is objectively garbage  it just feel like so because  expectation   warhammer   community  was high   relic had   options  follow  classic rts formula or do just like   they did neither  those  surprise surprise they managed    entire community  quite       ,0
same old warhammer just better graphics  meh glad i only payed   other wise i would be real upset  more than i am now  what  shame,0
i liked  campaign   was never interested in multiplayer    so i recommend  game  those who want  hear  story  play through  campaign is storyline  i was quite impressed  played through it twice   first time not on steam      ,1
i want  refund for this lazy       that relic made  well done  you basically destroyed  whole franchise with this thing ,0
game is dead no support  never  anything with  dawn  war    money grab with totally disregard for fan  very disappointed   ,0
good missions  i wish it was longer with more races   i wish we had last stand on  ,1
compared   previous games  it is  disappointment  i have played through  campaign   difficulty is not  hard so much as cheap  as  multiplayer was dumbed down into  moba  if you are going  get it  wait until it is    otherwise skip it ,0
i love dawn  war  from  beginning all through  expansions  into dawn  war two  all  there expansions  i still play both  this day  yes they are  but they are still better then what ever this is trying  be  i over paid for this game  i paid   for it  maybe   dollar then think about this game  its  biggest let down since  crusade  but at least  gave us something new  they tried  make  interesting game ,0
it is an awful dow game but most    it being   dow  game it is an awful awful rts game in general  most  your time spent in this game is waiting for your resources  going back  your base   your units   it is  waiting around  enough resources  make an army  going back  forth  your base  enemy    devs abandoned  game  did not even fix it  requisition gain is around   per minute whilst your units cost   power gain is sometimes    minute  you spend   on stuff          requisition  power gain in this game is so slow it is  stupid       only reason i bought it was  play    game  if you are only interest is that then buy it but if it is not then stay away from it ,0
lost everything that made this series fun then abandoned it rather than try  fix  really not  at all ,0
you have   great dawn  war series  this is ridiculous way  game was designed compared   other two ,1
 game,1
better than company  heroes ,1
 positive review is that i was able  quickly uninstall this game this game is awful do not even think about it,1
i am  big fan  warhammer but this game  i do not recommend  buy,0
two major issues with this game     they tried  make it  moba  they said specifically in an  they were looking at dota  lol when making     philippe boulle  he also said that if  players did not like this game then it is on them  essentially not taking    it seems  me that these are  two main  as  why this game is such   ,0
 is best game  only da boyz give da best reviews  orks is best boyz  da boyz are good  strong   but da boyz playing  da boyz  ,1
not what i expected for dawn  war  ,0
 original dow was one  my favorite rts games    was good but not particularly memorable  i had read  reviews about how bad   was so i waited  it was on sale  it is still not worth it  terrible game  poor mechanics  horrible single player where you keep switching races  just hope it has not killed  series  they can get back  its ,0
why are we here just  ,0
do not bother  only   armies available  no further dev support  they abandoned  game because  how terrible it is  it is just   with  few new things  i will be   original series  for more   more armies   more blood for  blood god  another failed attempt at  warhammer    game  added   ever  list ,0
if i had   one word  describe  this game it would be disappointing  although  graphics look great in my opinion   campaign is nothing special  what i assume was supposed  be  main    game  multiplayer  also   it seems like they tried  combine league  legends with base  army building   result was not something that was enjoyable  play  i have  add   here as i have only played against solo multiplayer with ai  so i might be missing some aspect  it that makes it better with other players  though i doubt it  this combined with only   race choices really   options that might have saved this game  they try  make up for  lack  races with selectable elites  army doctrines  while i like  concept   mechanic overall  it does not make up  lack  playable races  which was one   big parts i liked in  original dawn  war games  but  main reason i would not recommend this game is it is been abandoned so there is no hope  improvement or future dlc that might have made this game more enjoyable  ,0
i like  game   i understand why this game has mixed reviews  i agree that  game is not amazing but i think  relic deserves some credit    good   gameplay    gameplay is not like dow i or ii but is  sort    base building is back but not as complicated  some aspects  dow ii ability focused gameplay  trying    both games fans they did  good job  graphics    if i could run  game with good graphics it would look brilliant  story   not amazing by any means but it is good  i like    factions style  audio   impressed with  audio quality  voice acting is great  bugs   never encountered any bugs  customisation    army painter is great as there are so many options  skins for elites is  nice touch multiplayer    multiplayer at launch was not great  played out similar   moba  however with some updates  multiplayer has more modes  maps which make it feel more complete  unfortunately in     due   lack  players  game was   multiplayer is dead but if you have friends or  group  play with i suggest doing so    bad    voice acting  gabriel angelos     voice actor is fine but   will always be gabriel angelos  it does not sound right   animations   they are not bad just look very much like     from  gore  its just out  place   overall i like  game  it feels  as  core  both dow i  dow ii is so different  dow ii  aspects  both  however with updates  some thought  this game has changed  fair bit   more content than at launch  i would recommend but advise you  wait for  game  go on sale  buy it ,1
 emperor ,1
this is  great game  i enjoy playing it time  time  would have like there  be more races just like soul storm  hopefully there will be dlc  even free      ,1
i enjoyed  campaign  voice acting was fun  art is quite good  army painter is   great units  races are distinct  it was nice  finish  dawn  war story after   first game so much  playing through    as well  though it was less my style    i do wish it had  dark crusade style campaign mode as well  add some     music is not bad either  but not memorable   some times unit selection or ability  felt  bit off  i am not sure exactly how  describe it   i hear  word      some people   so i guess i will just say   are not as  as i would have hoped   honestly that is my main complaint  also sad  necrons  other races got cancelled   early negative reviewers    take  bit longer than i would have expected    i encountered zero bugs   i bought  game on sale  feel like it was worth it for  campaign  some model  alone  it makes me want  get back into      models again  i had an enjoyable time  will probably come back  run  skirmish or two with each army as well  see how they play without  objectives    recommended on sale if you want  see  story or  with  customization  or really if you have any interest in warhammer  no expectation  active multiplayer or  prettier clone  either    games  ,1
i actually like it  wish relic did not stop caring about it,1
nice rts game,1
not   game itself  but if you are  fan you should play this  it does feel like  warhammer game but story wise is rubbish  really  blood ravens again  so many chapters  play with   relic had  it again  its still  great game  really enjoyed what they done with heroes  reminds me very much  warcraft   so yeah thumbs up for this game ,1
if you are  previous dawn  war player  both      you need  head into this game with little expectations as it is drastically different from both   if you have little  no previous dawn  war experience  i personally believe that it is  very fun rts game set in    universe   fun campaign  dead multiplayer as unfortunately  player base  devs abandoned  after launch but playing against ai is alright  overall get  game if its really cheap  you just want some time  kill ,1
 warhammer   dawn  war   is flashy   with complex  micromanagement heavy   its single player campaign is long  challenging  but feels uninspired because it rarely makes  use   three factions  abilities  in multiplayer it s even more demanding   chaotic  but with only one mode  not  lot  maps  it seems limited   relic deserves credit for not simply   same game with prettier graphics  but this hybrid approach  t feel as strong as dawn  war   memorable tactical focus ,1
not as good as   but still pretty good,1
pretty good campaign  worth it on sale ,1
 only improvement this game has over warhammer   dawn  war ii is  graphics  literally everything else is worse ,0
game is shit   copy  paste   rest   series  where are  rest   factions      ,0
cool,1
i enjoyed  previous dawn  war with all   expansions  i also enjoyed dawn  war   which plays like company  heroes  small squads with  lot     best part   dawn  war series is  multiplayer with friends  i bought this game  immediately uninstalled it because multiplayer is broken where you can not invite yours team friends  i searched    this was an issue since   with     that it was  known issue  not being able  invite steam friends  play an rts makes me sad  do not buy this if you want  play with your friends  you will not be able  see any steam friends in  list  i am getting  refund for this garbage game ,0
my friends  i played  loved  other dawn  war games  we got this on steam sale because despite  negative reviews  we could play with each other  mess around  have fun        we could not invite each other  our party  there is no one listed in steam friends  using  steam menu  invite friends   game does not work  i  requested  refund  uninstalled  i can not believe that  game released in  last  does not have this  working ,0
i am going  try  write  review that could have saved me from purchasing this game    this game looks like  exact thing   dawn  war i player is hungry for  but it is mostly an empty shell   it would be  great    for those  us that loved dawn  war i  this game appears  finally be  decent sequel with base building    at first    it lives up  that   there are technically buildings you can build   but there is not much   game here    single player campaign is trash    all   races are  together  which means i have   through tedious ork  eldar shit before i can play space marines again   there appears  be only  single campaign  so for my money i have gotten about   levels  with one  them being  little more than  tutorial   some   new game mechanics  like these elite hero units are interesting  but there is also this mechanic where you have  choose different  for your army each game  like making your marine units run faster    this adds an  complexity   game though  how can i possibly gain  deep      its combat where there is are n  variations  gameplay    base buildings seems highly  also   you are no longer free  scale up power production at will   it feels like i am on     whole time    graphics are certainly  over dawn  war i   if it had   real  single player campaign it would be good   if it had anything close  dark crusade or soulstorm is campaign mechanics  it would be great ,0
this is such  garbage   game  if you like   please do not buy this game ,0
do not get this,0
for  couple  hours on campaign   tutorials i can tell   cons   its very bad that they   cover  building  mechanics    they basically imitate  moba style  play with troops as minions  elites as heroes   in  bad moba   bad dow   pros   visuals  elites abilities are ok    empire knights    campaign takes you through different factions on  single   better than doing  same campaign for every faction like on retribution   better off playing dow  ,0
good game  an interesting mix        im really enjoying multiplayer  singleplayer so worth  shot,1
 campaign is great  but i love  skirmishes more  ,1
it is  warhammer universe in all its glory  i do miss   game is base building though   ,1
this game  game is    is  pile  my   after poorly    i am unable  even think  creating   positive review on this game  how could you even think that i would never see this pile        do not you know  you make an     i am  god  very   could destroy  entire  system by simply   relic entertainment never do this again  ,0
great rts,1
great rts   amount  heroes   unit micromanagement remind me  warcraft   which i loved  battles are intense visually     i have played dow    this is unlike any  those  but it is  good game in its own   many people can not accept change ,1
i really do not understand  hate for this game  if you like rts games    you will have fun   base building elements are definitely weak  but  control points are   ,1
  sisters     every race heed not  call    gods  for this is not dawn  war    this is not  glorious  upon which     imperium have  their blood  this is  hollow     husk  barely  as      i got this game for     i still do not recommend buying it    fuck me it is gonna take  few days    get this taste out  my mouth ,0
this game was  biggest waste  money   developers gave up  content is shit  only three factions  it is basically  really bad moba for  ,0
this is  worst dawn  war game,0
with    steam community mods  maps available  dawn  war iii has finally been  far above it is original   vanilla release  i am enjoying this title now far more than i did when i purchased it on  release date way back on       i am  out  huge thank you   all  dedicated    extremely talented modders  map designers who have stuck with this title ,1
it is quicker than   ,1
this game has taken  lot  shit  but i would not consider it  bad game   bit uninspired    but not bad  it is lacking  bit  content  but what is there is decent enough   story was  enough  keep my interest up throughout  campaign  i would have preferred if there had been separate campaigns for  three playable races as  moving back  forth makes it harder  develop  feeling for  race  their    it is not worth full price  but get it on  good sale  you will get  fair amount    for your money ,1
my experience so far   hours gameplay  is not good     it was made as recently as   is  for  quality   tutorial by   voice  made me lose all will     in place for it were   i have already encountered  few random bugs  units moving but staying  etc   armies seem  be pointless compared   elites  as an elite can basically wipe them  which   question  why have  army  or why have  elite  some special abilities  elites are also   apparently launching over  large  is fine  though  can be found with small   wtf      standard army units   control  them is just ugh  you can select groups   which way they face when moving but they will not even consider putting melee at front  also most  them are happy  stand there  just get shot from    do absolutely nothing about it  so if you are being  by multiple   which happens  few times in mission   then you have  micromanage everything  it just makes  whole experience feel  little tedious  not that typical     there is no stance  that allows them  react  this  oh   every time i try  close  app after playing  game  it crashes  meaning i have  force   app down using my  system  i lose all experience  by my elites even though i played several games   good points  it was   for me on  deal  different  talk as you would expect them  talk i like rts games  this  rts game     i like   i am out,0
i am personally  big fan or rts games so this ones great ,1

 single player campaign is pretty interesting,1
being  fan   dawn  war franchise   how bad   was i still bought it       keeping true  each race   separate campaign would have been wonderful    for  series     elites  special  abilities  plus       unit control okay    unit upgrades  cool  i think though after playing it   jumping from race  race kinda got on my  always  tactics  i hope this does not kill   series  take  time  read what people want for gameplay   story is always   on top but listen   people   ,0
brilliant,1
fun game  i love   so playing as  space marines is amazing  plus playing  heroes too ,1
it is    dawn  war soulstorm ,0
note  i only played  campaign  only get it if  like me  wanted  have all  dawn  war games  i loved dawn  war    made several times  campaign  soulstorm expansion  i even liked  campaign  dawn  war   with  rpg elements  not so much  standard games because you would only make units  no buildings   but this game have very little  what i liked  previous games   basic thing that i loved about    universe is  gore  i did not feel it in this game  maybe because  unit models are so small but got none  them   game feels slow compared      other games  you have resource points but they generate resources  slow  some times i just had  wait in my base in order    force  start attacking  enemy because it was so slow   elite units in  campaign are nice but thats about it  i wanted  play this game because   titans  they are there  feel good  have that  power but you get them at  end   campaign so you can not enjoy them much   game lacks  most everything that i loved about  first game  liked about  second   shame because    universe is  great place for rts games ,0
its good,1
i have tried this game on two different computer        it is just    even   years on  i am sure it is  fun game  but i just can not recommend it  someone who wants  play  game ,0
fun game ,1
i tried really hard  like dawn  war iii  but   three games in  franchise this was   game   on  positive note  being able  use  titans was  blast ,0
brilliant update   dawn  war series  wish it didnt crash ,1
    short campaign      races only  no chaos  necrons  tau etc     meh multiplayer  buy only on sale ,0
from someone who is played  enjoyed previous   this series  take it from me that they completely  on this franchise  did an  by yet again    in game system  it went from base building rts   single unit control   mixture   two with  very vanilla storyline  they got  few  reviews   in  corner  decided  no longer support it   please only buy this game if it is discounted below  ,0
ok ,1
nice rts  awesome graphics,1
what  broken game  dawn  war    their  expansions are  much better than this piece  crap,0
actually i enjoyed it  dow ii was good but  elites  sheer increase in troop numbers makes this game more fun  dow ii was restrictive in  troop numbers  this is  big improvement ,1
bruh,0
  do not have any    animations do not look right  finished  first level  crashed     is like  different game from  series for    why change it if it is not broken ,0
i got this game some time ago  i did not remember why i never played it  today i tried again  now i remember   ui text scaling makes this game completely unplayable  i have searched around if after all these years they added an option or somebody made  mod  but no chance  will uninstall it for good  just  waste  hard disk drive  it is such  shame that  game  this production value is broken  just because  developer could not be bothered  offer  ui scaling option ,0
its  fun game  plus you can mod  hell  it,1
more squad based than  other games  though did bring back base building  bringing in  elite units   army doctrines  spice  game up more   i find there is no two games that play exactly  same    that being said  i very much wish there were more than just orks  space marines   eldar  very much lacking in  army options ,1
as   warhammer   fan  i like this rts game ,1
nice strategy game  perfect  combine   for this kind  games  for warhammer   in general ,1
i still bought it despite negative  after release  didnt play it much but i thought  purchase could help support development  i had hope that this game could be saved  just  few updates  more dlc factions  maybe  be as good as  ultimate apocalypse mod  but balanced    for   i hoped because this game has potential  unfortunately its abandoned  now my purchase was wasted   shame its  death  one   best   game series is out there as well  devs    should all be  for abandoning this game   series it  for  pathetic ,0
still prefer dow      think that  controls are off  sometimes do not do as u ask them  do  but still fun  d,1
if you want   rts buy dow      stay away from this game ,0
so much fun  ,1
its  great game,1
pretty decent single player campaign,1
single player campaign is great ,1
i have not played  multiplayer  but  singleplayer is just awful   it is essentially   just big  biggest mass  units  win  game  but with hero units that are almost  from  rest  your units that will   get lost in  rest  your units   good luck with that  because  hero units need  be  constantly   missions are full   which  when you  them   in massive forces from   so always make sure you have about     force needed  complete your next goal before you attempt it ,0
i loved dawn  war ii  but dawn  war iii is horrible   you play   different races  but instead    full campaigns   races are put in     result is   campaign with  races per mission  you do not even have time  get familiar with one race before you have  play another race for   more missions   i got  game on sale for around      any price higher than that is absolutely not worth it   now that i have play it  would i have bought it for    no  i would say  game worth   ,0
this great game,1
worth it on sale  picked it up for    no regrets,1
bought it on sale  considered it well worth  sale price     graphics  atmosphere   game is done very well      part   game is much more interesting as it has titan size units    its    dow       whilst an interesting idea doesnt quite work as waiting for certain resource points such as power takes  long time in game  units remind you  dow   types but are not as interesting in player  or as   although  disappointment  nevertheless   move by  developers   pity it did not work out well     story itself is  typical warhammer   nevertheless done well   story line in  is   there are story  however left   as  dow  warhammer fan however i still enjoyed it   get  game on sale    ,1
sadly by far  worst dow   singleplayer is so easy it is  joke  also it is more  moba with base building  than an rts  regular troops  only rarely needed  plus if used your hero levels slower    skills  unlock  nope nothing  do here     oh  your hero has just   left  fall back  screen   go get  coffee or do something else because after    he is back    health  even with  best skill you will have  do this   so killing is just  grind  there is no way    except being utterly stupid  going in  fight with low health ,1
great game  not  rts though,1
thanks  steam reviews  game was dead on arrival   it is hard  recommend it  average player count is usually below   so finding multiplayer games may be difficult   campaign was nice   it was fun for  time i played  looks great  gameplay is weird at times  heroes are op  shame we never got necrons ,1
i say this game is pretty  nice   any fans will appreciate it   ,1
it is like all  other games but worse,0
i have played both  dawn  war company  heroes   so on i knew  this company is great  doing strategy games   but let us say it clear   when i knew that relic was in charge  dawn  war iii  i was really hyped  now that i know that  relic is in charge  age  empires iv  i am really    ,0
i  enjoyed this game  bit  but i can only recommend it on sale  i got it at     even if it is not terrible by itself  actually  fun little moba rts hybrid for      it is   dawn  war game  with little resources or care  on it  half assed balance mechanics  poor   details   it has been abandoned by both devs  community   campaign missions are easy   even on hard but are quite varied  with bonus objectives  multiple   some   missions  there are resource packs around  levels  reward   early    final boss is  damage  with trash mobs  like   ones  but  difficulty here is way higher  against   storm   health pack management  heroes   mobs   boss stuns  are key  it is very  if compared   or   that were just  boring attack retreat loop   it will  some health  you will have three       your   clear mobs or pick up health packs  i like that  story it is mostly about eldars   best race   not  usual imperium vs chaos  i also liked that you get  play with all races  see their point    what i did not really understand was  whole reasoning       about  macha  because  bruh  me your strenght     when she would have   with   only   all     greater   or  throw away   eldar lives  except that it was also  bit   whole  lol just   battle  into  planet  who    with no  at all or noticeable    mediocre story without depth weight or memorable moments  except for     moment   entire    gameplay   gameplay lacks balance  its design feels like  bad  up  mechanics from dawn  war   dawn  war   starcraft    mobas   plus   it   ton  core mechanics  more in depth down below    base building first thing first base building is back   i like  lot that you can build your buildings everywhere since it    other good thing is that your production buildings are   little icons for an easy  quick alternative    but at  same time  lack  generators    locked  doctrines   multiple upgrade paths or  very fact that tech progression is literally based on your   not  specific structures   big  between all three races  are things that   remove any kind  build order  player choices or tech paths    build orders further  by  ton  potential upgrades  replaced by pre selected combat doctrines  elites   covers covers are basically gone  on   you have  control point that creates  destructible    makes all units  it   almost all kind  ranged damage instead  systems like destructible covers garrisons  light heavy cover  positive negative cover or garrisons  income upkeep  cap   whole management    upkeep is  complete mess   first  all you we went from      cap or      cap  an    population cap  but at  same time we have    upkeep  meaning that  more big your army gets   more slowly you upgrades tech progression goes   me this does not make any sense  an upkeep system works on  small armies skirmishes games like      upkeep  or warcraft     low upkeep     high upkeep   where you produce big armies  get  mid late game   knowing that at  same time you are losing income   down tech progression  but on dow what is even  point     cap when you start getting  at   population   bigger your army becomes  less you can advance tech or even produce power units  vehicles or specialized infantry  or get new units because your income  especially power  can go down  zero  here is  problem  how are you supposed   elites  tier   ultimates drop pods etc    or  with tons   units  no income   me it does not make sense  put an upkeep system thought for small armies in  game with this amount   damage  three elite units   titans  it is like  game wants you  start with very few units so you upgrade fast  tier    then play mid late game with  few tier   units     low price trash until  end  combat system my main problem with   combat system is that it tries  imitate starcraft     systems when dow is  different game  about tactical management  prolongued fights   certain   macro map control     is  game about   macro      micro with quick   fights    systems works well for   but are horrible for dow   units   damage  quick   completely remove your  tactical management  prolongued fights   since everything gets  in no time    problem  by moba  like  powerful elites   titan elites  overtuned ultimates   system that is basically all about  skills   crowd control  mostly stuns              long gone is   system    or even better     skill systems from   other thing i do not get is why still lock some doctrines  colors behind  grind  or even    even see non purchased skins  overall    cartoony  looks good on eldar  mostly mediocre or  with space marines   gabriel angelos looks straight from league     it is horrendous with orks  it is like they came out from   at times  voice acting is overall mediocre or   actually horrendous on orks  gorgutz   kills are gone  there is  ton  animations spells that  warhammer lore  like gabriel terminator backflip or  turned into     whole  interface is  bit   especially  heroes   storm style map that is not  into    works well for  but not for   even if i like  total war  unit icons    lot  sound effects  attacks  animations  voice lines lack any kind  weight or   super elites  imperial knights      are  best thing    they feel powerful  it looks amazing   with your army  by your personal     that is all i have  say about    mediocre  disappointing game  good for  few games  nothing more  it was impossible  save because it was badly  from  very beginning  especially   drive into e  where even starcraft   barely  even with  strenght  its name    do not be sad that   happened  be glad that it died before doing too much damage ,1
i am trying so hard  force myself  play this game so i can finally finish  available series     but its just so hard  get into it  yes it is more like   but it really is not like   at  same time ,0
this was  bit   miss for me  i will start by saying overall i actually like this as  game  it is just not  good dawn  war game  just about every aspect  this is  step back from dow   from  gameplay    campaign  even  soundtrack just does not have that same magic  previous games have  relic seemed  have had  bit  an identity  with this  while i can see how they tried    lines between   there is  number   steps that hold it back from getting    that vision  flow  let us talk about some      production quality is top   graphics animations are killer  it is got all   you want in  warhammer game   three races  play  each play pretty differently  have their own mechanics  level  skill  master   campaign let us you play all three races at once   between them  this works well as an  tutorial  sorts as you get pretty well  with all races by  end  it is also well voice acted  is plenty long with lots    some fun character       hero types  doctrines  you choose special bonus options for your troops before you start so you can customize play style  actually lead  some pretty interesting play styles  now some      while i did not mind  idea behind having heroes take center stage  for  most part they are way  powerful  it is really  race  getting  most powerful hero out because as soon as you do it is pretty much game over   visual  at late game  especially with multiple players is   there is so much going on at once your whole army will die in   seconds  you will have no idea how    above  me   fact  micro you need   play an army plus three heroes at once  especially if you are  weaker eldar  is insane  let me say that again  in  moba you play one hero  you can focus on doing it well  here you are expected  play three heroes  an army  only  micro god can play everything  way it is meant   it is not really fun   with everything   wrong  with  wrong heroes constantly    campaign is     fine but mostly an  in patience as you attack move your way through    it with stops  wait for  slow   requisition needed  rebuild an army that got   killed by enemies spawning in all around you like magic   story is  ok  but again  step back from previous games   power core mode is dumb  again an attempt  make  game more like  moba  it just does not make much sense with this kind  rts gameplay   you can fix this by simply playing annihilation mode    not enough maps  environments  modes  no last stand  even though this would be  perfect game for it    game is currently abandoned  dead  no one plays   ai is quite bad  this is  real  in   for me since if you got  game today there would not be enough staying power  make it worth  in  perhaps if you are  warhammer fan  pick this up for cheap you might enjoy it  otherwise you can just go play more    will have  better time overall so it is for that reason this game is not recommended by me,0
how  kill  franchise   everybody asked for      we get this  piece  trash ,0
dawn  war   is  pretty basic game for what it has  offer its basically dawn  war   but with    attached at  very end  campaign is ok for what it offers but  other then that multiplayer pretty much is dead for good  there is  bit  unit  with  workshop mods but that is basically it,1
more challenge than previous versions,1
do not know why they decided  take out so much   customization from   like    in this one you can not actually pick your characters  like in ii   camera is alot closer  i really like dowii but after about   hours  this one  its not great  just ok sort    it really   mind why they would take out character upgrades in  rts rpg  its really stupid ,0
its  ,1
not  best dow but not bad either  if you are unsure get it on sale  give it  try  campaign has  similar feel  previous titles  took me  while  get used   slightly different game style but still feels like dow overall  unfortunately large armies are  bit awkward  look after  at that point  numerous unit abilities are  bit   i found abilities awkward  activate in  middle  bigger fights so i sometimes ignored hero      this game has had  lot  bad rep so i waited several years for  good sale   before trying it   i am glad i did not get it full price but i am glad i have played it  i think they could have turned it into  much better game with  solid patch   i just hope  next game moves away from     per minute  emphasis ,1
  good game  reminds me  coh   which i also love    game is not as dead as some seem  believe   i can find  match within  minutes late at  when no one should be on   i got it on sale  would not have bought it full price  but it does not deserve such bad reviews  i believe most bad reviews are from people who were already fans   franchise  got disappointed ,1
this game is fun  somewhat  but  entertaining ,1
let us either have  remake     collection so we can get  old   feel back with high end graphics  or  let us get    with all  factions from         survival was really fun     has  ,0
it doesnt have half   real units  factions in warhammer  it just isnt that fun anyway,0
campaign is so boring  poorly acted that i can not keep going  gameplay mechanics are outdated  poorly   even for    it is not worth it ,0
i actually think this game is pretty awesome   visual effects  sounds are great  people are upset that its not close enough   original dow but i am judging it as its own game   on that   it is pretty awesome ,1
wonderful graphics  intense battles  epic  say  least ,1
for someone who is new   warhammer franchise  has never played dow   or    i have  say that this game is very good   i have been an  gamer my whole pathetic life  at my age its hard  find games that are appealing   definitely worth every penny ,1
i know i know  this game does not have as many playable empires nor does it have as many vehicles or customisation as  original dawn  war but hell  i enjoyed it  fun campaign  multiplayer is pretty decent  good buy for  price ,1
this game took way  much un fair hate  sure  multiplayer was  failure but  campaign is actually very fun  had it not been given so much hate at launch  it could  fixed its multiplayer  been  great game  but now   dead game  i would  loved  get necrons  tau     rest with this level  graphics   shame,1
rip dow,0
this game gets   lot  bad press  it is true that it is not as fleshed out as  previous titles    but  graphics are  done  they really bring   from my   life  particularly  eldar look amazing    multiplayer for this game is fun  action  with good   i wish more people would play  it is definitely worth  sales price   it is  shame relic never fully finished making this game all it could be  but it is still  fun game as it is ,1
great game wish they add more people like chaos  stuff from   game ,1
amazing   just needs chaos space marines,1
i do not give  fuck about dow  dow ii  this is  solid rts ,1
if your computer can run this game  its super fun  got it for   dollars  it was worth every penny  not as many factions as dow   or   but more fun than dow   not  mention it has  ork  eldar titans ,1
i played   ii   this game was just terrible  awkward mechanics   was annoying  camera  annoying   through for   hours   gave up out     tired  storyline  orks are attacking imperial forces  space marines come  save  somehow eldar are involved  but it is really  plot  chaos all along ,0
i guess for  fans only  not good for new players,0
any warhammer   game is interesting  me  as third installment  dawn  war series it is  must have  game  game itself is good  not great but good enough  complete  story  gabriel angelos  blood ravens chapter ,1
it has good graphics,1
these graphics  models    i feel like i am playing mobile strategy  not  dow   dow   are much better  i completed   missions  then i had no   continue even though  next mission was eldar one which is my favourite race ,0
worth  sale price ,1
fan  dawn  war   or   avoid this game  it is utter trash  does literally everything wrong  should not even be possible,0
 game was abandoned by devs  is it worth it at its current state  no   only   hope were  promised updates that never came  they will not deliver promised updates  because  game underperforms  but  game underperforms  because they did not deliver  promised updates  they said they were going  focus on other titles  good for them  i am going  focus on other  that do not abandon unfinished games ,0
boring  does not feel like  dow game ,0
great game ,1
this was  miss gameplay wise    ,0
can not believe i had this game     perfectly good disk space  finally got around  it   finished  campaign in casual  time for uninstall  this is prolly  worst game in  series   it doesnt provide anything   its another try   together strategy  rpg  it kinda worked on dow ii  but not this time  this game features very slow units  including   eldar in    d    tedious missions    that is usually  in  mess  units  effects  mostly useless elites  imperial knight kind  op   single camera angle that sometimes changes during missions    chaos did not see that coming     who gets  down for  final battle    this game also has maybe  best intro movie ever created  so its not total loss  in     rpg   dow ii    strategy   dow soulstorm just  myself  get  taste  sega from my mouth  ,0
finding it  be  fun experience  takes  bit  getting used   it never feels like you get energy fast enough  but i am having  good time playing it ,1
heard about dawn  war     remaster  something like that   should use graphics     ,1
i love this game    i recommend it  anyone  everyone   ,1
any fan   warhammer   universe should have  great time with this game ,1
tldr   it is  fun game for  solo multiplayer  last part   campaign  do not expect anything complicated or nearly as interesting as  previous games  however   game can be incredibly fun at times which i can recommend  on  deep deep sale   game has it is really fun moments from time  time   graphics  sound  music  voice are really good which is why i did not write anything about them    i have tried writing this review  few times right now but there are so many things right  wrong with  game  however it does not  at anything   bad things are incredibly noticeable  annoying   keep in mind i only speak for  campaign   ai multiplayer part   game  that only     total players have finished  campaign in normal difficulty when reading other reviews   game with less than   hours which is  average playtime  it   speaking   campaign  i have   it in half as    quality  it changes drastically  note  missions take an average    minutes  complete  not  joke    missions   final boss  some missions may take even longer if looking  complete  side objectives     first half  it is  mess  boring  dull  confusing  you are just  into it with no   what is even going on or why you are doing  things you are doing   if you have not played  first two dow games  i have played them  finished  still had no idea  what was happening for  most part     game takes more than half   game  fully  its mechanics   player  so you are mostly locked into  units  game wants you  play  not what you may find fun or interesting or even allowed  experiment on your own with  different factions   missions drag for over   hour at times  however this is due      missions  which is for  most part  same except for  last mission   most missions start you up with your leader   few units   goal is  find  place  settle  base  then build units    enemy base  generators  towers   other buildings  on  map   this  as  building  is incredibly slow with limited resources  your generators taking forever  produce said resources  other missions start you up  same but it is   hold your ground  type  mission  these are  worst in my opinion  sometimes you just get overwhelmed by  attacks  not being able  produce defenses or units fast enough  all  this while trying  complete  side  all over  map with more enemies  which in turn requires you  build more units  take even longer  finish  some  these hold your ground missions even have      second half  once you get used   missions  how they  out  you can finish them  faster but still within          hour per mission   as  game  you are given  lot  free units  free resources throughout  map    need  wait for  generators  pump these resources  not only is it more fun  send your incredibly big army against  enemy  but also being able  use vehicles or different units as you experiment with them  this is  part in  game in which even though  missions drag on  you can actually have fun while doing them   there was one  mission which was    run stealth type  thing  which had  least combat but was  lot  fun  go through it    final mission was probably  most annoying   whole game  not only does it drag on forever but you are limited on  number  units you can use   final boss has some  attacks that pretty much  your leader   wasted opportunity for  good premise   ending is lackluster  definitely not worth  time spent on  campaign  there is no resolution    that was at hand  you do not get any  post fight     game just  ends in  very  way except for  one  that  ork says before      talking now about  units  they are nothing compared   previous games  mechanics  use are completely different  most   units feel unbalanced or useless  even  vehicles feel lackluster     elite units are  absolute best in terms  use  visually  most appealing however you do not get  lot    use them  their full   not even in multiplayer as  match is nearly over when you have enough points   them  most unit abilities can be completely ignored  not worth  micromanagement  them especially once you have  bigger army it becomes  mess  try  select  use your units abilities    game throws some faction mechanics that improve certain aspects  units or their  or abilities  this comes as   from  first mission you do not even know which units are which so you just select whatever seems nice  they are not only  waste  time but also annoying since you are mostly just   same over  over during  campaign once you eventually know which unit does what    story is  mess at first switching between factions with you not knowing what is going on or how they   each other  however this all comes   clear after  first half   game  then you understand not only their  but also what  them  it  however  game  characters out   air for plot armor that makes it very confusing again  know what is going on   game is worth at  very low price for  campaign   few fun  against  ai  can not speak for  online multiplayer which is what most people play for so it is  their  against  game  play without comparing it   other games   franchise  you will eventually have fun with it just  around  battlefield ,1
impossible  play   locked continue button isnt  wtf,0
great game  love it,1
campaign is okayish  but by far  worst dow ,0
it is fun  but  somewhat shallow game ,0
 game has alot  problems with it    no risk style campaign  no real    no last stand   what is does great at is   game play  no  just war  if you are playing with friends this would be amazing  sucks there will not be anything added  this but  online was just  bad idea  i think if they kept it like just  better better    had last stand this would have been  great game  if it had  risk style  campaign it  made dow dark crusade  ,1
solid rts with good cinematics  art   voice acting   campaign  you through  three factions  tries   you for multiplayer while taking you through  story ,1
what  say  it is an awesome game  fully enjoyable  more playable than other rts on   that  only on apm or  mechanics  good job,1
 story mode is short  simple  only  few challenges on normal  honestly   games i have played  on other   on hard it really is not that challenging   game  enjoyable none  less ,1
play all  these back   original ones ,1
disgusting ,0
while i play dark crusade  soulstorm more than any other game  this one was seriously   i feel    i will also admit  that i would love  see  single campaign with  originals with one huge uber world with all  maps  make up  seriously massive game      mod can not be impossible for that   but no    was not  bad game at all    they kind  tried  bring  game back   original style  but with   graphics  they honestly lost out on something that was  seriously major thing   but then i feel they also failed with company  heroes in much  same way ,1
campaign is super fun with    story line  unfortunately can not say  same for multiplayer aspect  this game  in  dow ii was  far  game in every way  i hope next version  dow series is more like dow ii ,1
personally i like    do not understand  hate it got at release  just  they kept  cover tactic from     would have  down  game play   made  battles  bit more tactical  if you can get it on sale its well worth  look ,1
this game is an insult       shame,0
one  my biggest regrets in life is this game failing,1
 worse dawn  war i ever played  what  waste ,0
good,1
very disappointing campaign  not  patch on dow i or ii,0
it is fun in   but in   it is fairly meh   if i could vote  ameh   i would  but since i can not  i am  no     single player game is   tedious   i do not play pvp  so perhaps it is brilliant there  but based on other reviews  i expect it is basically  game which  you for being an   hyper focused      which is fine  if you are one  those   otherwise  stay away ,0
first  all  im really sorry for   who made     cutscenes   ost  those are amazing  but  rest  total rubbish   their good work down in     beating  dead horse here im sure  but this game is so bad  i do not know what  say  just played   space marine  this  from  same developer  yet  differences could not be greater  space marine is    this is utter trash   they wanted  make    dota clone  it shows  angelos wears terminator armor with         around like   ball  utter    i can not recommend this even on sale  get   space marine  pass this waste  your time ,0
so when i picked this up  i was so  that this was called  dawn  war  i could not play it  they made  really unique  awesome franchise so generic  bland  now after  lot  patches i beat  campaign  it is more playable but still just generic rts  further  story is     cinematic with    is  best one in  game  like most    cinematics  are just like    at best   final fight was tedious   ending  as fuck  can we just agree that this was all  hoping   on  cash grab by building up  franchise so it had  good rep  then  this garbage  just make that   which now that i think about it is kind  on brand for games workshop    i would recommend you play total war  i mean its fantasy  not   but maybe we will luck out  they will make total war  ,0
i very much regret purchasing this game at full price     if you want large scale combat  play  first dawn  war     tries  play on  large scale but since every single unit type has multiple special abilities   gameplay mechanics becomes overwhelming  frustrating    if you want small unit combat  play  second dawn  war     tries  play on  smaller scale but  sheer   units on  screen at any given time makes this style  gameplay pointless     third    dawn  war tries  be both  it just does not work    single player campaign very much plays like  grind  i did not enjoy it at all   i am very disappointed that they have essentially destroyed  dow franchise in  same  as   who have in  past destroyed amazing franchises like command   conquer       is  total waste  time  money ,0
glad i picked it up on sale  any more money  i likely would have felt like i wasted my money  you might be  as  why i have   hours then  well  that is easy   campaign   certain redux mod   campaign is really meh  but i wanted  see it through  so i did  that took    hours   rest was using  redux mod for this game   that mod makes this game enjoyable for  time  but even that got  bit boring over time   pick it up when its on sale for  ,0
glad i paid    ,0
very bloody,1
burn    this game is  failure in all levels  it is not fun  it takes  squad base tactics  dow    makes them much worse     has as shitty voice actor   single player is boring   missions drag on   why was this game made    kids need  not be allowed  make games    here is how you fix dow   relic  bring back glory kills  bring back bases  actual bases  hero is need  be weaker  not  point   game  keep  squad level ups   make  really massive player game like in dow    which allows you  have real  for  blood ravens   world they fight on   or say fuck it make another game like this  fail again   relic i have played almost every game you have made from  on  this is below you ,0
not  same experience or feeling like  first   games but still  worthy   worth  money ,1
requires   play style than previous entries  this one is closer  straight rts than  rts small squad real time tactics    still pretty fun ,1
only played  campaign  here  pros  cons      good graphics  excellent animation   units  good warhammer feeling  means lots  war  death  action      story is ok  but  special     unit    units do not react while enemy units shoot them   is meh  you can  almost any mission with gathering  big army    enemy  boring   almost no  from  enemies on your base in  most missions  its pretty hard   enough  for  your units in some missions     game stopped  they even canceled content because it did not work well in  former   for example  elite units gain experience but can not increase in level anymore   overall i have had some fun moments with  game but can not  it because  all  flaws it has ,0
i wanted  best parts  one  two  i got  worst parts instead  whole things seems unfinished  few armies   boring hero  mechanics   not bad    graphics are good   writing is crap   story line is incredibly boring  linear  lack  choice really hurt this game  i bought this at full price  do not be   like me  do not buy it all ,0
it is fun,1
despite it is  lack  content  care from  developers    game is smooth  beautiful  it is not dow or dow ii but it has it is small qualities  there are plenty  extra maps  mods in  workshop  help put in  content that sega could not bother doing themselves  i recommend getting this game on sale  like i did when it was     using  revolution mod from  workshop for multiplayer   campaign is  made as well ,1
its not ok ,0
it is really not as bad as people   sad that dev is just gave up on it  i do   dev is for not  it  be as good as i could be  really needs balancing  space marines are  absolute god  not saying  other   races can not   just an  battle with      been playing dow since og release ,1
being  huge fan  all that is     fan    i did avoid this game due   bad reviews  but buying it on sale  completing  single campaign  it was not too bad  had  base building  large unit cap though there was something missing  but i am unsure what it was   graphics are good    skins are awesome  just wish it had more ingame close cutscenes like    you did not feel attached  any characters like  first two  plus you could see  ending plot twist   away after playing  first two games  though i will admit i am gutted there will be no more with  end     next   added races   i just wanted  play as chaos   ah well     ,1
what happen with elite experience   im  mission    all my elites are still in level   with   exp   going on   i earn exp in every mission  but at  next is   in all races my elites have   exp ,1
enjoyable with friends  only   this game is that you can only be   factions     missing  other factions   ,1
let us be real here  nothing beat  old games  i know  series lost fans after   but let us not look   horse in  mouth here  we got base building  good unit match ups  not great  not perfectly balanced  but good   really good resolution   servers are still up  people do still play  it is worth getting if your are  fan   series or  lore but not if you think it is gonna  dow  dow soulstorm ,1
bad game that  in  face off warhammer  ,0
you have    issues but worth its different kind  dow but fun,1
it definitely has its pros  cons but i think  game has  lot  potential  when i first played it i compared it heavily   other dow games  was not happy with my   although  seeing  game as its own product made me  that it does have  few    first off  graphics are great  there is  lot  consider   game mechanic  micromanagement wise  unit interactions   make  game more fun  enjoyable  buuuut there are    way that you can late game key units  like  imperial knight for example  is through  different resource that allows you  bring them out into  field  not so bad right  wrong   problem with this is that it takes forever  get that resource  you have  capture  specific  point  get it  so  if you want  play  late game unit then you have  do  well in  early game  hold onto that point against your opponent  have fun with that  another thing is that you only get three elites so you have  pick very  on who they are before   game  it requires  lot  thought because dow players are hard  play against  theres more  it but i do not wanna   game plus my  are tired ,1
fun  challenging in multiplayer   ,1
its fun ,1
game blows,0
this game moves further away from  base building     continues  smaller scale battles    both  these styles choices were moving in  opposite direction  what i wanted for me   lack   defenses in  campaign forces you  either  your  forces   or  in esports level  micro  keep on top  things   frankly  i am getting older  just do not want  play  game that fast paced   demanding  i play games    not hyper    quit    i  that this micro heavy direction was   attempt  attract  star craft   style esports crowd but it utterly turned me off   i think  elites  their art style were made  look like   alternative  dota  both  these likely  decisions  utterly flat for me    voice acting was okay but still  step down from   heroes  previous titles    ai was non  for your forces which you can expect  stand in place until death when shot    level design was okay at times but felt very   linear in nearly half   maps  i wanted  skirmish type battle which only  later in  final missions ,0
very nice for  singleplayer content  campaign is fun  has  warhammer feel  it  three races seem small in number  however not bad ,1
 in   that could  been great if relic bothered  update it in  same style as dawn  war  ,1
i got this game on   sale  still mildly regret it  while it has all     dawn  war game  it is missing  spark that made  previous games enjoyable    i bought  previous dow games purely for  campaign  still felt like i got my money is worth  i have now made it about halfway through this campaign  just can not bring myself  finish it  my biggest complaint so far is that army management is  chore  fair warning  i am typically  marine   player on starcraft  so micro managing is not really my   that being said  this game somehow has  worst  both worlds  there are more units used than in    several  those units each have special abilities that you will want  activate at key points in  fight  this requires keeping track  units easily    between them   hero units you will be using  this feels  with  increased size   army      while  army size increased   management tools have gotten worse  i was unable  find  via  game  or by sheer chance   ability  add  unit  an existing control group without having  remake  entire group  in previous games i have played  number creates  group   shift number adds  selected unit   previously created group  this is extremely  as you progress your army  make more units   same   without that ability  having something as simple as  control group for all your units becomes  chore  every  single  time  you make  new unit  you need  group everything back up  separate via    create new units  if you have units in multiple control groups  e   ranged  stealth  then it is even more      game seems  want you  create larger armies  but lacks  tools  enable this    in short  i would not recommend this game  anyone that is  fan   series  is looking for more single player content  it seems they have   have  best  both worlds  have failed     requires you  build  larger army   management tools do not enable you  do that easily   campaign lacks  customization  fun from  previous entry  just feels  bit flat  i have not tried  multiplayer  but that is not what i buy these games for  i would recommend  this one ,0
let up  our  in  moment   for  original  is gone forever   as  years go by   from  loss  such  has yet  be   that being said   is  better than   in every way  after getting through  first couple intro chapters   game opens up     joy starts  build  it may not capture   essence but in its attempt comes  spark  nostalgia   i find myself wanting more  if you are  fan   original  this game is on sale  grab it ,1
not good  get back  dow  ,0
 bit dull    bit buggy   it    or just crash outright fairly often ,0
lack  content but game just didnt get enough love for developers  add more but i enjoyed this game,1
  got his hands on  copy  gave it  me   game is not dow   or     good   i  i like  heroes  base building is back  looks    bad  almost all  it   factions instead    on base was  big     focus on  game being  friendly  them  remove  awesome synch kills because  synch killing unit is  which   balance  bit for  longer  ones  who thought that was  good idea    game is  so we will not even get more races    only part i liked was  heroes system although they feel  powerful    final score it gets   on  scale where   is perfectly average   it should have released with   factions as  base ,0
not much   sense  achievement with this one  story  along  progress only depends on how many units you can throw at  enemy  not enough  on unit variations  abilities in terms  strategy  certainly better games  its type out there ,0
i got this game on sale    believe  reviews for this game  story is awesome af btw,0
 campaign is boring  slow   tedious   unit control feels terrible ,0
this is  hard one  make an opinion about  it feels like company  hero is  but less if that makes any sense  it is got  less faction  in fact it only has   groups  space marines  eldar   ork  in dawn  war there are   groups with souls storm  in dawn  war   there is   groups  now there are   groups  that is bad  there are new mechanics that make  game fun  but at  same time you can not get  full experience in any game  it also hurt  game that half  everything is locked off  if you want  play  campaign just youtube it  if you want fun with lots  options  groups play dawn  war     ,0
good game,1
i like when big angry  does cool flips in air,1
its cool,1
i love dawn  war games,1
it  good at  start but what  let down   game  have been dawn off war for  lot years now  am  for my refund can  tell how it takes  get ya money back ,0
i am glad that elites are now unlocked ,1
my god its slow  boring without mods  every mission in  is   minutes  waiting for resources   another   minutes  your troops trying  kill  single troop  your enemies  every skirmish is  same   you wait for god  amount  time  get resources for  single unit   then watch how  space marines try  kill orc troop for    minute   this is literally unplayable without revolution mod   i highly recomend   it  because it makes skirmishes so good  you will not be able  play original game again  if only original game was like this ,0
i have played all  dow so far  this one is not terrible but it is by far  worst  playing as  eldar  which i  enjoy  is just frustrating as it takes them   be able  do anything  it is  only game   series i gave up playing simply because it was not all that enjoyable  even though i did spend   hours on it   bring back  way  first one played ,0
in addition   other reviews     i am  nobody said anything about lol like graphics  especially  heroes  giving thumbs up only in condition  sale buy  if you are  big fan      about  game ,1
i have played all  dawn  war games  this one is pretty fun  would not call it  best out  all  them but pretty fun ,1
good game  ,1
i am so disappointed  if you ever played any other warhammer strategy game  you will be completely  by this game  here is  quick summary why      knights  uber units     that kinda   lore  bit  thats one big thing that was missing in previous warhammer games  negative  you army is completely useless  be honest   there is no balance   your units have no value at all  feel more like   especially  space marines should be these super  but fail do anything but   enemies   campaign     no dedicated campaign but more   gathering  skirmishes  where did   story writing from dawn  war   go  where did  campaign map from dawn  war    dark crusade  soulstorm  go     from dawn  war   gone  base building like in dow   gone  i guess my point here is  that they tried  create  completely new   this was not requested  we loved  way on how dow      worked   details   love  that went into these dows were fantastic ,0
i bought it  i played once   i never asked for money return  worst game  do not waste your time money  if some one know    have  money back  please tell me  i played   hours since i bought it ,0
got it for    still felt cheated    put it off because my friends who play warhammer games would not really touch it  i liked  use warhammer games  play when i can not go  my game groups  i see why they will not,0
looked great  felt like  dawn  war game  some design decisions make it feel  bit  down between an rts   moba  still was an interesting experience considering i got it on sale ,1
this  good game if you like your rts games   campaign is pretty decent  i have played enough  enjoy it   only really bad thing i have  say about this game is  wish it could be more like  original dow series  it is an improvement from dow   but nothing like  originals   overall its  step in  right direction  any  or new dow fans will still get enjoyment from it ,1
this game is fun but i would not recommend it unless you find it really cheap because  game play gets  very quickly,0
enjoyable  play rts with  great warhammer   feel ,1
terrible game ,0
i as  huge dawn  war fan finally decided  get this  play it during   despite  terrible reviews  online   was not worth   do not waste your money   i  do not waste your money     gameplay   average  only campaign as multi player isnt working  graphics   barely updated with less gore  less actual interactions between enemy characters  bugs   half  titans get stuck or can not attack units,0
oh sega  where do i start  all you had  do was take dawn  war  give it this game graphics  that was it  instead  we got  campaign that flips between who knows where  who knows what  terminators front flipping into orks because that is  thing now  eldar that are  well useless because eldar   stupid ork upgrade mechanic that makes no  because most scrap is in  battle  they get  while doing their little   seconds   through   shit oh i mean scrap  which is what relic let sega do  this glorious franchise  dow had twice as much content in it is first instalment than this piece  work  wanna know why  aside from  chaos space marines because you know  relic forgot about dawn  war   chaos rising canon  instead  we get gabriel smashing up stuff due      has forgot that  warp  his chapter   gorgutz somehow coming back from god knows where   some eldar that are  i do not even know why they are here  so in all in  sega gave us  gold old finger instead    game  wait  is this ea  no no  it can not be right  relic  with ea  ,0
great strategy game  fun story based in  history   warhammer series  have not played  others but fairly easy  get into  excellent graphics  fun gameplay  however multiplayer  skirmishes   close    lane based moba   actual game mechanics can be fairly complicated as well    lot  micro management  key     took me  while  get into  work out how  start   best play style for each faction  if you are looking for  good rts then definitely worth  play  however expect it  be more simplified in gameplay  but more complicated with heroes  abilities  which  game heavily depends on  than   or  etc ,1
no necrons  no dark eldars  no tau empire  no chaos spacemarines  no    fun i guess if you like graphics  playing with only   races     rich universe  warhammer  better   dow   ultimate apocalypse ,0
not as good as  original but still fun for  casual play through ,1
it is not  bad game    but if you have played dawn  war      you will not like it at all    instead  going forward they are  back   more  less   for me it is  franchise killer,0
much better than  reviews would indicate  this is  really good rts   fun  play campaign  cool units heroes    overall this is  great game  i recommend it ,1
 franchise killer    warning sign     dawn  war   is  last game relic has made   it is almost impossible   all  things wrong with this entry      in detail  its shortcomings  flaws      is  stuff  hour plus youtube video      with  examples     is points   avoid it   at any price it is  disappointing waste ,0
campaign provided   no experience at all for my elites  either this is  bug  which is  sign    or this was patched   make it harder  level up elites  which is  sign      my experience with this game has been    than i  from reading  mixed reviews      updated review    having completed  campaign  played   skirmishes against  ai  my complaint  has become less clear  i still do not recommend  game  but for  different reason that i will get  at  end   game is playable  good even  if it were not  dawn  war game  it might have    it makes sense for me  start at  beginning   intro video  have you ever looked at  piece  art that looks pretty  but you say  yourself   i do not get it   that is how i felt when i saw  intro  at  end   campaign  it makes more sense  now i can say  i do not like it  instead   i do not get it    but on  some  campaign       varied missions  more varied than dow   or   i can not immediately recall two missions in dow   that played  same      missions  you how  play each faction  dow   does this better than most rts games i have played  due in part  mission variety      terribly    story   plot twist at  end   campaign is   plot twist in warhammer   i mean it  until you get there   campaign does  poor job  out  characters or  story  i had  go on     out why  chapter master   space marines would be so   even     regular human   solaria  when he wears his  for an  on his     ending  well  it just feels wrong in    game      elite units are mostly fun  there is an ork mission toward  end   big gate you should   purely by chance  i brought an  elite that can    gate  so i played  whole mission never smashing open  gate  i do not know if it would have made any difference  but it was fun that i could do it        couple  cheap ai mechanics  mostly toward  end when  re   enemy units are  as  new faction       really nice   dow retribution in  last mission      voice acting is  quality than dow      especially gabriel angelos  gorgutz  angelos  voice is so deep   i half expected him  rip off his power armor  show off his  like an action movie hero  gorgutz   be simultaneously less fun  more  than  ork  in dow    so as i played  campaign  i found  mission themselves enjoyable  but i could not bring myself  care  there was no    this is almost  exact opposite  dow      whose missions get repetitive pretty fast  but whose plot  characters really keeps  game moving forward  as  fan   first two games  this was  huge letdown   yet  for someone who is not    fan   shortcomings   campaign plot likely are not as obvious  it might even be  good  feel good campaign   i have only played  limited number  skirmishes  what i found are these      elites  doctrines add  fun new layer   existing rts formula  if  game were not dead  more elites were added  they might even have created   game      diverse play styles for different factions   differences go  than dow   or   due    new mechanics  drop pods   scrap    webway  soul recall   other smaller unique features      moba  i do not think  power core maps were   be moba  moba games are  not by    towers   core  be destroyed  but rather  emphasis on single unit      neither is  enough in dow      power core maps  i think these maps were just relic is attempt   units into bigger fights  them all over  map  capture control points      why no  point control maps      dow   could have had great  or at least fun    rts  moba gameplay  i think not having  more dedicated moba mode does not count as  minus since it is not   dow   gameplay  it is more   missed opportunity   my problem with  dow   single player can be  with my problem with its intro video  there is good game here  just not  good dow game  possibly  adopt  more        devs     soul  this game  good level variety  fun game play mechanics can not fix that  just as  intro video is simultaneously well made  pointless    multiplayer  or for me  skirmish   is also ok   elites add an interesting new layer   game play  i guess like  super    day rts  it is not quite fleshed out  with more improvements  it might have become great  with more effort   multiplayer could have evolved into separate traditional rts  fun moba game modes  that is not going  happen now   here  my reason for not recommending dow   not because  game is so bad it is not even worth it on sale  but    individual developers    with  game is   i mentioned in  beginning that i  next  no xp for my elites in  campaign  i also could not earn any xp in   maps  i think they were patched out  here is  thing   only people who even care   xp for elites  including achievement   are people who want more out   game  they likely make up  majority   people who still care about  game   devs could easily have gotten rid   skulls  unlocked most elite features without making it harder  elite up elites  which now has almost no gameplay  anyway  instead  they gave  big middle finger  this group  for  game where    players completed  campaign  fewer than half even bothered  finished  third mission   devs did not just burn their   they    so nothing would ever  again   i am so glad philippe boulle left relic ,0
just  copy paste mechanics  nothing too great  all factions are  in terms  building  unit   is just  look   ,0
good,1
much better than  reviews would indicate  people were just mad it had some aspects that  like  but  entirely differently than  moba ,1
playing this game reminds me  when i saw my     when i was  it seemed  lot bigger  better  but as an  i  it is nothing special ,0
not like soulstorm do not recommend,0
great game  please add more content factions    ,1
its shit,0
cheap starcraft  set in    universe  everything feels wrong in connection   setting ,0
first  all  this game is  disgrace for  warhammer   dawn  war franchise  bruh like   all we wanted was more races  play  that same old mechanics from first dawn  war  btw this whole thing could have been  by  few updates buuuut  developers abandoned  game   so do not ever spend  dollar on this game  let us hope they will learn from their   make  better sequel,0
wanted  love it but just no,0
no decent cinematics    battle campaign  in one for all three races   space marines models look like they were  from dow_ii   only three   vs numerous back in dow  dow_ii    when i look at starcraft it makes me so sad  because   deserves  be even better   but its not even close     only thing i liked is how some orcs units  buildings were made ,0
please read  this game is fixed    has  been removed normal  mode is back  game is way better now ,1
its  good  those retards are just baby ,1
its good,1
lovely game after patches   ,1
bad,0
 game is futuristic  very well made in detail   game play is dynamic  diverse  there are many different  that  player can experience  game in connection with units tactics     game has depth   in    warhammer universe  in  new  way    it has   vision  value   franchise   it is sad  see that  lot  people are  with  new angle   game   i understand  appreciate  games    prior  this one   but development  change are always  ,1
good  game,1
get  go     campaign sucks  no loot  no hero leveling as in dowii  no    achievements are buggy  do not unlock  only   playable races  tries  be moba  really  fail   this is really disappointing about   steps backwards especially after games like dowii  company  heroes    assault   go back  play  good ones    assault  soul storm  dark crusade  dowii expansions   sega        its    on     on its way out   ,0
really good  although   was better  they made maps  small in   could have been great ,1
rip dead  never  rise again   real shame though  i feel like  game had potential but  devs tried  turn it into an rts moba hybrid that just didnt work out  story is so  it is just sad  achievements are just finishing  story  grind every elite   level can be easily done with mods  ,0
can not understand all  hate for this game great story good graphics amazing ost  great battles based mostly on micro  ok its  bit different from other dow  rts games but  doesnt mean bad  dow   in his own way is  great game ,1
i did not play warhammer   series before  as   i can say this game is quite good  most  negative reviews are from warhammer fans  when this game does not  their expectation,1
not  big fan   moba elements  very nearly would have preferred   company  heroes ,0
it is good   enjoyed  story  if you like   then  probably like it ,1
good but needs  other races,1
i get it that some people would hate on this game  but for me it is  fun game  ,1
people talk so bad about this game  but have  what dawn  war ii was when it launched  what dawn  war i was when it launched  there were plans  make add ons for this game just like they did with dawn  war ii  add races  campaigns that would have more choice   content within  but this was supposed   us over until then  now  now it is dead  it is sad how  we have all become  we used  just love warhammer  now it is   do better or fucking kill yourself games workshop        i was  bit disappointed too until i  how dow ii was at launch  only game that had  few more races at launch was dow i  that was because no expectations were on them  deliver it   dow ii was   update graphics  ship it out with  quick campaign while learning how  work with  slightly newer system  same thing happened with dow iii but nobody wants  talk about that  just about how they are   everything they want now ,1
if you like games like starcraft ii  warcraft    command   conquer  you will feel at home ,1
please include more race like imperial    tau  dark eldar  chaos  this could be more fun  then make it more strategy gameplay like dow  ,1
warhammer dawn   fails  live up   standards set from previous versions   micro managing is hard lack  other factions  limited amount  units available   textures look cartoony but  shot graphics are good   campaign is bad  i did not feel  love into this game this is  by  spacemarines  being completely off  i give it  thumbs up because its worth     good time   i only plan on finishing  campaign  thats it ,1
they   mass army s from  first game  combined it with  special ability s from    game added  few more features for  race then remove some health  main units making micro  main thing  master for  competitive scene how ever they never fixed all  animation  ai bugs that make characters stuck on other characters or just stuck in an animation loop totally  out  micro   if they just used  month  this game it should have been great  ready for  small e  scene,0
good game ,1
 first two are better  i do not really like this game much  might finish  campaign  might not  prolly just gonna play more dow ii,0
so i have been  dow fan since  first  as i am sure many here have  i have  buying  game for  number  reasons  but honestly upon playing it  i  it was because i kept comparing it   first dow  in its own right  if it  before  first dow style game  i would have loved this game  at  discount  i feel like this is  good purchase for any fan who loves  dow franchise   campaign is somewhat short  but i felt like  missions were varied enough  keep it interesting   as  game is no longer being  however  i have  recommend it only at  discount for true fans   franchise ,1
if you are      its  good enough   pick up    i would wait for  sell  for everyone else looking for  solid rts experience    i would go some where else ,1
great looking game  i preferred  squad feel   second one but going back  traditional rts is still awesome     especially warhammer universe ,1
how  butcher good      in one step  this   when i was playing in   i could not stop  after playing      i had enough  stop playing it for  long time  when i came back  try again  give  shot  it is still not playable  very sad  be honest ,0
after coming off  dawn  war  its sub titles  jumping into this game felt pretty similar    ameh   i heard dow iii played very   dow so i went back   myself on how it played versus dow ii  its sub titles   graphics are great  sound i think comes across as   nothing in  game really  out when     or melee occur   factions are  start  eldar feel   desperate for micro management  orks are orks  space marines are clunky  not in  good way  they came across as  least  than anything   storyline was not really engaging  i play dawn  war  experience  stories   warhammer universe  i think dawn  war  dark   soulstorm  more intriguing story    which they really did not  i did not care enough  try  get  titan    were   did not care about those either    overall i was looking forward   game but left with my    so  speak  i hope something helps in  future  make me want  come back  it    workshop will do what workshop do  all  content  on there  thanks for putting out   content that i feel should have been in  base game ,0
these  do not burn in  fire ,0
i personally enjoyed  time i had with it  i hope relic will pick this game back up again,1
this is not  dawn  war game  dawn  war was amazing  dawn  war two was    different  but at least it still kept with  spirit  this  is some sort  husk   corpse   once great franchise  abandoned by relic  buy at your own risk  it will not change from here ,0
what an  game  i would recommend this  anyone who has ever been involved in  warhammer   universe  not only is  campaign well written   multiplayer is smooth  so much fun  pity  game devs stopped any new content from being   i would pay top  for new content  dlcs    ,1
i like some   new units   i am  eldar        game so good  see  fleet   mechanics      graphics are good   i enjoy  storyline lore    i have only played  first   missions but have liked what i have seen so far   although i think i would have preferred separate single player campaigns for each   races  i do not really do online     my favourite dow is probably  dark crusade with  nice blend    several races  do choose from ,1
 good game  there are options  make it just like  past dows if you are   change  kind  like   skill takes time but is rewarding ,1
ok  so this is another  example  how one   completely  opinion can    or     game on its release  so far all    towards  game in  negative review  is just  bunch   who are very pissed  not have    dawn  war    not  new game which opens  new     would this game not be   it wouldnt  just   storm it did     devs have shit  say either  im in no way  them  they could have      known  community  warhammer   fanbase which i hate   myself   not do   out move with  any support on  game   game is very fun  campaign is very interesting  cool new animations   scale  battle is increased so drastically that it is   as  up as apocalypse mod for soulstorm         matches are very dynamic  you increase  scale  battle with time  for    three  fighting each other like in    you have insane mechanic  elite units too  game is worth its full price in my opinion   get it on  discount ,1
please upvote   keep this  alive   please sega  relic  feral  do not leave this game  i have very good reasons    this one is    bit  i know but i loved it  i would like  see more  like new race   campaign or other mods    modders in workshop also very good  needs more  by trying  liking maybe their work anyone who can  this genre because      this is  fantastic mix  different rts       only has  huge fanbase  people  including me   also  rts  moba players like    gathering    or as i say requisition  energy    race        i mean orc  human    i think huge target  people would give it  try especially if you come again with some  expansion maybe  i would  recommend  share  just like now  thank you in advance,1
played for about     game looks terrible  feels terrible  play  its  shame i loved dow  ,0
no tactics or cover  just make  big ball  units   up  map  shame really ,0
only worth   like what i paid  no  or  or custom maps so basically no online play yet has xp  piece  shit devs who abandoned  game because it got bad reviews  instead  fixing it just said fuck you  well fuck you back   theres no cover system anymore  yet has lots  text  that there was at one point  heroes are unbalanced as shit example  gabriel angelos gets   stuns   gets    eldar hero gets   if you are very fucking talented    certain units you never build because completely useless  every race unit  exactly  same with vehicles being  major difference with small   infantry  most op units are  ones that do full damage  all armor types as usual  some are tier   units   do not even know why i bother  game not getting remade nor is there any dlc coming out  they out for good   this game is fucking shit when it comes  strategy games  have you fucking retards even played one before making this game  theres no  stance  or defensive stance only hold fire or hold still  your units will literally stand there  get fucked until they die because someone they can see but can not  is      them  you didnt command them    when you make ai face  shows you there is no unit balance  heavy  towards  ,0
you are not   ,0
 worst part from all   dawn  war games   too many micromanagement in gameplay   gameplay not exactly  same with previous parts  just   races   boring company   so   just because we have not other good strategy games in warhammer   world         was  ,0
game got linux support recently  i   why not  game is buggy  clunky  does not support  cards yet on  linux side  things  i was  quite  bit    too  just avoid this game  not worth  ,0
 those warhammer   dow fans  this game no worth your money    time  i bought this in  price yet still disappointed when compare  dow   dow    expansion set even dlc     not much fun    yet some   workshop mods content extend this game life  little   please if you want refund  remember  do it before    hours game play  thank you  from  dawn  war   dawn  war   dawn  war   chaos rising  dawn  war   retribution  ,0
look how they  my boy   ,0
its just dull  it looks amazing but  combat is super simple  restrictive  too much micro management  make units  ,0
sucks that relic  ship on this  its  good game  people are mad that its not  dow   copy  its balanced   it has some great content   buy if its on sale,1
takes   bit  getting use   but all fun        ,1
looks great  plays great ,1
i paid   on sale  for that price i would recommend,1
idk what all   is about  sure they have removed  lot  customization options for individual units but they have also  increased  overall command cap as compared    which is nice  more    giant elites they have added is pretty cool too   campaign is fairly decent  not as  as  previous parts but still pretty intense however  it is lacking  lot content for  dawn  war  which is disappointing  still not  bad game  i really wish they would release some expansions  add ons  ,1
 buggy  shallow game play   missions   better off playing soulstorm with mods    pants ,0
there is  bit   learning  compared  most rts games   games that came before them but its an amazing  all around,1
play dawn  war    its  fantastic game that has  very well   in short dowiii is okay at best  but   by      dowiii suffers from  same problems that  star wars  remake did   there was  lot  live up  in  original game    lot  things that  community at large wanted  expected out   new game   they made  product that looked like it was in  same  as  original  but failed  deliver those most important features  community was  looking for   one such feature was  massive   depth  factions available   there were i think   factions in  old dow   each had different tech paths    massively different mechanics that made each one rewarding in its own way   it had   campaign mode where you would conquer different   for different resources or upgrades   really fun     with  new version  factions are cut down     they feel less different than in    they have cut down  options for game modes  they even got rid  free camera control for some reason   we really needed  remaster    or  completely new game   this game is stuck halfway between   that is      that could be  with  brand new game    as  result it  into    trash between    make it worse   lot   changes they have done seem  be because its easier   cut down from like   maps   well fewer maps is easier   cut  number  factions into  third   well fewer factions are easier   factions are really similar   well more different factions would be hard    you get  idea ,0
it is just ok not great just ok ,1
great  rts game,1
an amazing rts  one   best i  played  although it takes  really powerful computer  play  graphics are great if your pc can  them   they are     loved  campaign    multiplayer is ok  if you can even find  match  only   people online at one time    i have read  other reviews   bad ones all hate on  fact that it does not follow  lore  well yes  it might look weird that   in terminator armor can backflip  jump super high  but i do not mind this  i do however wish that they had more game modes     cost  heroes or made  elite points  faster    i actually like  moba elements  i surprised myself actually  i usually hate mobas      it is an all around good game    mods make it even better  i wish  developers did not drop  game  it would be even better ,1
ah    no  just no   bland boring rts with    moba  badly over it   horrendous  that   you between races  they even dumbed down  game from dow       bad game  now abandoned   thanks feral  you killed  great  by having your head  far up your own  you  or wouldnt   anyone  ,0
played this game when it got out  it was trash back then  nothing has changed  it is still trash aside from  model quality,0
very good fun game  multi player is working for me so i do not know what  other review are talking about   some people do not like  mix  elite  build base units but i think it  in  lot more   game  would be great if you could have more than just     races tho ,1
 great combination  mechanics from  previous two games  campaign seems short but i only paid    so not  big deal  me ,1
i really wanted  like this game but even on sale    is way too much    game feels   empty  something is missing   game play is slower than  other dow games  voice acting is not what you would think   animation is more stiff than dow   i would not even recommend this as something different from  other games in  series,0
unlike most  da comments i is in love with da  game  as an old   da game i can easily say its still great,1
like it,1
very nice special   game itself is not too bad i just think for something that came out   they could have at least added more races by now  not charge for  new races would be awesome,1
thank god for steam  ,0
this isnt  dawn  war  i thought   retribution dlc was bad but   not going  push  finish this game  its  most hollow  empty campaign i have ever played in  rts genre  who even likes  be forced  play with eldar  they have taken   steps back with  gameplay as well ,0
 weekly gathering      i do not know why there is so much bad review for this one  i just simply refund  buy it back when it has    off    be honest this is not that bad  also discord community is pretty much friendly  they have weekly gathering  online   they share how  be better for  next match also told you some    d  i just play less than      more than    summary      maybe  you can spam   type  unit  win again  again  i have no idea about gameplay balancing   i just saw      unit looks cool  able  do       play could be less than   for single match    do not play single player for this type  game  i will definitely ask my friends  go grab it when  price is off    you have  join official discord  ,1
pretty good game but i see why everyone   game   i kinda like  old versions  better then this  probably  remaster i would ask for for  old ones those are  good ,1
 online multiplayer did not work      refund  did ,0
bought it during  sale remembering  fun i had with  previous installment  just  its nothing like  originals  has  moba playing mechanics    no  just no  back  total war   for me ,0
got it on  cheap   i know most      fans hated it but for    i think its well worth it,1
its all  worst parts  dawn  war    all  worst parts  dawn  war   put into one game    ,0
as has been said before  get  game on sale   i actually really enjoyed  campaign mode  for those  you who enjoyed  previous campaigns  you will probably get about   hours  enjoyment from this one ,1
aside from  few bugs  this game is really quite good ,1
 understand from where i am coming from  i need  describe myself   i am not  competitive rts moba player  but  simple warhammer   fan   casual rts player   most   things that i liked in  previous games are missing in this entry   single player campaign is too short   story is boring   voice acting is too bland   ending left  be    gore  kill  are missing   ui is too complicated for me  use because its hard   what each  do in  heat  battle  unlike in dow    units themselves are also too complicated  for example  you got   types   units that you can produce  instead  just creating one type  just  them with    like you did in dow      or  fact that you also have   type   units that instead could be just one unit that you could upgrade with     game was    point its  too complicated since now you need  memorize what each units looks like since everything is damn too small  sometimes even bland with  terrain  also memorize   each ability when it could be much  like it was in dow   where there were big armies on  field where you could   units on  field   them on  go   i can not recommend this game  its just not worth it   its missing  important part   it is not  fun game ,0
solid game,1
nobody knows why  devs decided  take  tried  true   formula  try  turn dawn  war into some click frenzy league  legends moba   there is literally no strategy  this game like  old ones  you just spam  units  send them in  auto attack in  giant frenzy    this is  game for  not  audience that  dawn  war series had ,0
really bad,0
shallow   if you liked dow   slow  clunky if you liked dow  ,0
meh,0
how  kill   franchise  game ,0
how can this game be listed as  online pvp  if there are no online servers   all support dropped  nothing  add  or  help in anyway   it is     breaks my  ,0
been told  lot  bad things about   but honestly really enjoying it  base building is minimal compared    but much closer    than   was  especially when it is on sale ,1
game not that bad   ,1
  retribution at full price is still  better value that   at   off     is easily  on sale for   off    out     ,0
do not buy this  even if it is on sale  vote with your   my  already went into  dumpster on release  keep yours clean  do not even waste your  on this   it took all  elements       that you liked  forgot  add them ,0
this game was such   disappointment that i did not even manage an hour  it  it plays kind  like all  worst parts  company  heroes forced into  fantasy strategy game   if you want  play  dawn  war game  settle with dawn  war   unfortunately this one is not going  cut it ,0
pathetic crap  it has no soul  i am   disappointed at how poorly they have  warhammer   essence  spirit in this poor excuse   game    also   actual gameplay its boring  sucks  some kind  shitty hybrid   rts  moba ,0
i have never done  review for  game before    do not buy this turd,0
i was on   on not recommending this game on  first   minutes got crashed  i gave it  second chance  i played  mission  kinda boring  animation does not look that good  orcs feel kinda op if near at base  anyway  it is very bad in my opinion if you have played dow        i would recommend this game not because   discounted price but because i loved  franchise  i hoped they will make  sequel  will not f ac  it up ,1
ea has killed another franchise ,0
let us start with  good things  visuals  sound    that is it  if you want  generic rts  buy it   on discount  if you want  dow   sequel  run from it   they have taken  visual look    eldar  orks  but nothing else   they sound  behave   with no soul or anything near   them with warhammer   feel or lore  as many sad before it is just sad as they had   great games  take from   even this   in such shit state could get fixed if they put   little effort  they  killed  franchise  abandoned it  disgusting    ,0
     were great  right  for once  sequel  its original  for fans  starcraft  command  conquer  dune  all  other similar  this was going  be good yeah   yeah   nope   honestly this feels like  fallout   failure from start  finish   how can an up  date game be worse graphically    in gameplay than  first   this looked  felt like  game written for     not    release pc strategy game     out    for this release because its gone backwards  ,0
i love how epic  game play is ,1
do not waste your time  just go play either   first two  you will have  lot more fun ,0
could have been updated into  really enjoyable addition   tw franchise  but  devs  ea    out  abandoned it pretty  month in  so if your someone who did not buy it on day one like me do not bother  you will just be wasting your money on  corpse  absolute shame  absolutely  developer ,0
     do not buy       best review i can give you ,0
lol  one   worst dawn  war     no  worst rts game i have ever had    playing  it was almost like   had no  about warhammer lore  honestly was just straight up boring  play  even  end was generic    worst game ever ,0
release half complete game that needs tons  work  get mad people do not like it  cancel all work  updates in  future     brilliant   complete spit in  face  fans ,0
rts is are not moba is terminators do not backflip    god space marines are not   ,0
bad graphic  not as good as     ,0
too much micro management on battles  you wait too long for resources  shame what happened   series ,0
this game is  tier  could you just not       i mean  seriously  this game is  biggest  in warhammer   move over  death  our beautiful    i mean     you have been    after two stellar entries in  franchise    on dev team  got together   said   you know what  what we really need is    moba  except  let us completely butcher  lore with new canon   completely ignore everything that made this series great      get this  they are going  love  fact that we could not even get  moba part right either     we are gonna immediately abandon it as soon as it blows up in our face  how is that for           i hope you are ready  pump out space marines with        in league  legends  seriously    on       fleet  will live longer than marines in this game  how is that for lore faithful   when  world needed them most  they   just like  is dad  in fact  your dad is going  come back from    or  call you on your    long before relic ever  they  this     in  face     level    devs simply just slowly  out    going   you did not see that  nobody saw this    except  every time i open my steam library  play dawn  war with  ultimate apocalypse mod  do this btw if you want  true   rts experience  i have  see this   not even  could love this   every now  again   like today  they have    put this back on sale   they are  still  selling  game  meant  be an online moba  with no servers so no online play  i mean  it was bad   with but now you are just paying  play against garbage ai that will not even challenge you   worst  all is that you must accept   together   story in this game as  canon progression  several   og dawn  war campaigns  guess that means back flipping in terminator armor is canon now too   if for some reason  you are still  over   add    button despite all   above points  just ask yourself this    emperor died for this          upon  for   because  technically   servers are still online  but they may as well not be because you are paying for  dead game   game is community is essentially   for good reason    it is dev abandonware  i do not see why you would or should pay for this game when you can have great mp experiences in several other warhammer titles   i mean  really  there is simply no need   that  in this title unless you are truly bored  desperate  if you are anything like me  most  you steam  want good  games  play  so i  you  look  ,0
this game is  spit in  face  dawn  war fans  they also got angry at fans for not liking their objectively bad game  dropped support for it almost immediately  it is  multiplayer focused game  there is no multiplayer anymore  for  final f you ,0
i get sad when  game you did not like  you bought for full price   then much later it is   off     ,0
good   combat ,1
game feels incredibly  designed for something that full price is ridiculous  i have   hours  me but i have played enough games    bad one  petty developers abandoning   is not  good thing either ,0
 sad end   stellar series,0
do not buy this   that is all ,0
worst  wait  pre order ever   would not recommend  would  all relic  sega games until  full  happens ,0
for anyone who has played dawn  war   or company  heroes  this game is  massive disappointment   for anyone who has played star craft   or   this game is  big let down    i would  this game around dune   an abandonware game made in  ,0
sadly  game died before it was actually played due   massive amount    i  enjoyed myself alot  recommend you check it out if it is on sale   like  dislike  from  reviews in my opinion are not accurate  advise you  check it out before you form an opinion  this game because i think thats what killed it in  first place  i feel this is not  enough so i give you this instead  an actual review   game is content   hope you enjoy it ,1
does anyone even play this game anymore ,0
bought it at full price on release remembering  good old dow i  ii  believing in  devs   i was wrong      do not be like me     as things stand now it is basically abandonware  they release  terribly unfinished game that managed     fanbase  seeing that  game   they   just abandon it   once  official price goes down      or less i will change it  recommended since  mediocre campaign is fun  you can   few  into  skirmish mode  until then  not recommended ,0
 big  in  dawn  war  ,0
this game is worth it on sale for   it is not like any   other dawn  war is  it is worth     if you liked  older dawn  war is  try it  you will understand  but only on sale in my opinion  there is about    worth  content   ,1
bad,0
 dawn  war series started out incredible then   with every sequel   i am disappointed   point  angry   easily  worst thing about this cut  half assed you would think ea made it  is knowing how much better relic is     these guys used  well earn their    now this       emperor   dark gods        bloody well everybody else   get  first game if you have not already  let    in  warp ,0
probably in   here but i never  all  hate this game got  i enjoyed it much more than   which was very poor  if you liked   dow   was not  your taste you should like this one   for me it was  dow game i was waiting for years  too bad they killed it when they cancelled updates dlc  still enjoyable from time  time  play with friends or  ,1
people are  about it being too different from   but   isnt anything like  first game   standards  ,1
sure  this game is very disappointing  but honestly  main reason you should never spend money on it is  fact that it could have easily been fixed  made into  better game but instead either dev or  publisher decided  cancel any updates  dlc or service  any kind after  game received bad reviews  one   most petty   moves i have ever seen that gives ea some stiff  in  world  giving  finger    do not  any  pay money for this game ,0
an     dawn  war setting     i enjoyed  campaign   titan units  imperial knight    but not many new changes or new feeling   game     yeah  no dlc races as mentioned by others  which would have increased its  many times  not sure what went wrong there  do give it  try   on sale     solaria    yeah there is only war    ,1
what  turd ,0
such  shame  i  up playing dow     ,0
i have never been more  by  video game existing,0
buy dawn  war   or dawn  war   instead  not worth it ,0
 is  mind too small for doubt,0
not  best game on  franchise  but you can have some fun time playing it if you find it on sale     my soul just  knowing this is  last game ever on this great franchise  we need    old games or  new dawn  war iv,1
good fun  some tactical   patience,1
cash grab,0
its not as good as    but its close enough at     price ,1
 sad excuse for what should have been  great game   devs basically took all  worst parts  previous games  made sure they kept lots  annoying active abilities that you can never control enough   then combined that with giving fewer races  play then  first dawn  war  then took all  good parts  previous games  made sure  throw out all  that so it would literally be impossible  have fun   also if you were hoping  play as our favorite space marines  ya know  center   dawn  war series  i hope you enjoy    whole missions they have while you slog through  awful eldar missions   half decent ork missions    only redeeming quality  this game was finishing it so i can uninstall it  never have  play it again  also who was  absolute  who added  in  game but when you fail  mission you only have   options  restart   continue        none  these options  you     ,0
 great  grimdark sp campaign  with funny  for balance   coupled with  mp mode that   hero characters    with  army battles     it looks  sounds just right too  highly recommended ,1
great warhammer universe rpg   its  shame  game    it needs more content  bad ,1
by far  worst   game i have ever played,0
decent game  an ok campaign  custom games with friends is actually fun if your  casual rts player   be  this game is not getting dlc or updates  but please do not  this game by  mixed reviews but take  time  go through  garbage reviewers  look at  ones with more than     because let us be honest most  them took  time  at least get their money is worth   actual good  bad things with this   overall this game is not  complete  mess as many   reviews state ,1
online play is dead  do not buy unless you only want  play solo against bots or have  skirmish with friends from   game  i was  about this game after playing tons  dow      but it was  complete disappointment   pros   mechanics  graphics are    elites are  core   game  put out some flashy attacks  cons  there are only three factions  space marines  orks   eldar  i understand that balancing them is difficult  but  out chaos   others is  disappointment  at launch  for years   unit choice was locked behind an online multiplayer grind  but  online community died after  few    campaign is linear  has no replay value   offers no  choices ,0
kept me  for  couple  days during lock down ,1
all i want is dawn  war game with more races  those little cool kill animations ,1
save your money this game is suck  control   no custom hot key no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes no skirmishes,0
i know this is  little late  post  review on this dead game but i have found that if you have     play with  you      marines   mod its actually an ok game so if you already bought  game  its too late  get  refund  recommend getting that mod so  purchase  for ,0
awesome game,1
in all   it  t  game itself that failed  graphics were fine  it used many elements from previous titles  what i think made  game fail  was mechanic  lack  both content  lack  factions  which  t all that bad  each faction is either lacking unique units or lack   as it is known for   only reason i recommend  game is  fact i   major fan  this series from   if they added more factions  better gameplay i think it would make  more decent game,1
no dlc no update,0
great rts   if you like warhammer even better,1
i love  warhammer    universe  i knew this game was different   other dawn  war games but i didnt expect it  be this different  in fact they should not have called it dawn  war   as it is  completely different game   first   my main issue with this game is that i can not just play as  faction i like  i like playing as eldar  i do not mind imperium  i dislike playing as orks  yet i have   between all   factions which means two    time i am playing factions i do not really want  play ,0
online servers do not work  you will not be able  play online  heed my warning  save your money ,0
i like that they made  game that uses some aspects  dawn  war      combined  space marines having great vehicles  eldar having  but very strong  fast unites  orks having cheap unites  so they can out number others  elite unites having  lot  complex abilities  uses  i like more complexity in  way that i need  learn  abilities unites  use in combat for    so in that  i do not like that some unites like for example  orks   eldar unites have only have one ability like     i like that  orks have  scrap system that they can upgrade almost all  their unites with some ability add on or damage    story is great  unique in it is     lore  maybe i could change my mind after learning more    lore   i am sad that they canceled  necrons expansion  i would have liked  see how they designed them   in all things considered i would give this game  weak  ,1
love this franchise ,1
  weird taking cover mechanic  i really enjoy  game  shame devs decided  abandon  game ,1
did not care for this game at   it was such  change from  original  but after  couple mods im having  blast  no limit mod  elite unit mod  actually really enjoy this game co op skirmish etc ,1
was  something more rts     they keep   very present    good but takes   off building your own strategy  anyone  would play has  do  same things  same way  once again     like   off rts games is  another   first  build       making units  fast you can  send them  your enemy just   type off  its not strategy   ,0
i bought this dumpster fire on sale  i regret it      game for  while still   it not because its hard but because its just  bad game   ,0
if you are looking for more content from  classic dow games  this is not it   i could write  whole long list on why this game is not worth playing but its just so bad that  list would not be worth your time reading   just do not bother    too far from  light    ,0
this game is fun  entertaining  me at least  i enjoyed  hybrid   thing that they have going on here  shame they are not  it tho ,1
 very enjoyable game  cut short   i wish it had some expansion packs  dlc,1
compared   previous dow  game is more  around   special units like your hero   squads or vehicles that you can   with skins  colors  with also level progression system  those special units  skill cards  or adding new skills  normal units for  between those units    worste thing probably would be    spells  are way too op             also  lack  all  factions that s  worste part  i nearly forgot that  only   factions are present  space marines  orks  eldars   there s mods though in steam workshop like for company  heroes   with maps  game mods  there s  mod for   factions  missing just necrons  sisters  battle  but it s really unfinished   af  also if you start  mods it s   game itself is poor   devs are lazy or incompetent   so   it up if you compare it  dow    dow   its  heavy  for sure   lack  content compared     previous ones is too big  get  positive review tbh ,0
fun  has  strong feel   warhammer   universe   diverse game play through different factions ,1
 campaign got  pretty interesting story  it,1
i remember  time  i remember  place  i remember  game,0
it is warhammer  ,1
bought  game thinking it would be like   or   but it was not  campaign was  as i am  space marine player     time  did not enjoy  between  space   dumb orcs  game was visually brilliant   actual game play was good i just did not enjoy it ,0
there are two prior entries in this series  i fully  them  ignore dow     you will not regret it ,0
bad community  no random team button   old players play together     i had  good level but there are no players online due  that     loss  time,0
 game that  between dawn  war    dawn  war   is good at neither  as in all things  mods make it kind  fun  but  graphics are so cartoony  fun does not last very long  get it on sale if you are really interested ,0
i brought  game when it was first released after having played  first dawn  war along with all  its dlc for many many hours   little bit on dawn  war   but this failed  live up  expectations  i recently  it again  see if it had gotten any better  there seems  have been no difference  they have not even added more races  you are still stuck with  options  space marines  orks or eldar  that is it   online seems  be dead now as there was only   game running   everything that made that first dawn  war so special has been lost on this  this is not worth  price tag   pros  nice graphics  voice acting  good customisation options for your armies   cons  not worth  price tag  campaign is too  multiplayer is dead  no improvements made   game in years  only   races  does not live up   first dawn  war which was released   years ago ,0
 campaign is good   mechanics are also pretty good   game has gotten quite better since launch  not  mention  graphics are pretty good,1
no multiplayer support anymore  game is not worth your time  check out company  heroes   for  good rts or play  old dawn  wars ,0
i have played this game for  few hours now   all i can say that  warhammer games are only getting better   every time i watch  intro i  my pants with excitement ,1
it is alright if you are not     ,1
this is not  fun strategy game  it deserves all   that it got  going back  dawn  war    never  this again  such  waste  time  sad really ,0
